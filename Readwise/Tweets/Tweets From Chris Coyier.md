- One thing I like about `gap` is that it doesn't force the gutter size, it acts like a minimum gutter size. So if you space things some other way, it can be the the that prevents elements from butting up against one another. https://t.co/oWczLi4Zch 
   
- Once Firefox supports the min() function in CSS, the famous CSS grid auto-fill snippet will definitely be updated to:
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(min(10rem, 100%), 1fr));
  That way when it gets down to single column it can actually go as narrow as it needs.
