- 👨🏾 The reader isn’t just a blank slate that you can write your message on. They have knowledge, beliefs and emotions of their own. A big part of writing clearly is to start where the reader is now, and talk *to* them – not just at them. 
   
- ‘Don’t obsess over grammar. If you have to obsess, obsess over clarity. Write as clearly as you can.’ – Neil Gaiman 
   
- 📖 When people read, they make links (called ‘associations’) between what they know and what they’re reading. Then they fine-tune these links to build their own mental representation of what the text is about. https://t.co/kSvJmrDAlY 
   
- 👨🏼‍🏫 The principles of andragogy, or adult learning, suggest that grown-ups learn best when they know *why* they should learn something. 
   
- 🏋️‍♂️ Clarity is the writer’s responsibility, not your reader’s. You’re the one who wants to get this message across, so you must put in the effort to make yourself clear. 
   
- ‘I get nervous when people are glorying in the jargon of their profession. That, to me, points towards an insecurity.’ – Dylan Moran 
   
- 🖼 The great advantages of the step-by-step structure are transparency and modularity. The reader can see all the steps before they start reading, and they always know where they are in the sequence. 
   
- 👜 The word ‘metaphor’ (μεταφορά) literally means ‘carry across’. A metaphor carries meaning between two ideas. 
   
- 🤓 When you’re close to a subject, it’s easy to overestimate how interesting other people will find it. 
   
- 🩳 If you’re unsure how much to write, go shorter. You may leave some things unsaid, but very few readers will complain that your writing is too short. 
   
- ⏳ Readers’ attention is a finite resource, and you should always make the most of it. However, it’s not like sand running through an hourglass, dwindling with no hope of return. You have the power to create more of it. 
   
- 🧞‍♂️ Forget about tips, tricks, hacks, secrets, formulas or short-cuts that promise to make you a superb writer with zero effort. Cutting and pasting is the opposite of learning how to write. 
   
- 📨 Titles should tell the reader what you’re going to say, how you’ll say it and how it will help them. 
   
- 👣 If you use the step-by-step structure, the reader understands straight away that you are talking about a process with stages. That prepares them to think about temporal sequencing and causal relationships. 
   
- ‘Don’t obsess over grammar. If you have to obsess, obsess over clarity. Write as clearly as you can.’ – Neil Gaiman 
   
- 💞 Empathy has two sides. Cognitive empathy is knowing what someone knows, thinks and feels. Emotional or affective empathy is actually feeling the same emotion. 
   
- 🧵 Longer sentences are harder to read, so many writing guidelines suggest keeping them to 15–25 words. https://t.co/j9Q23SwjNp 
   
- 🔢 To make things clear for the reader, describe the parts of your sentence in visual, logical or chronological order. This will create a progressive sentence. 
   
- 🔻 In the inverted pyramid structure, you say the most important thing first, then add more detail as you go along. You start broad, and gradually get narrow as you focus in. https://t.co/SCnB4m6Scn 
   
- ⏩ One study found that clearly structured paragraphs help readers read quicker, understand better and remember more. https://t.co/0QQf42CFRZ 
   
- ‘I didn’t have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.’ – Blaise Pascal
