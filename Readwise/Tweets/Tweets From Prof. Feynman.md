- Understand. Don't memorize. 
  Learn principles, not formulas. ðŸ§  
   
- Your intelligence cannot be measured by a number. It is defined by your willingness to learn, solve problems and try new things. You are more than just a number. Develop your skills. Share your brilliant ideas. Your skills are more valuable than your grades. ðŸ§
