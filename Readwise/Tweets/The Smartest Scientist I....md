- The smartest scientist in the game:
  Andrew Huberman.
  I’ve listened to 100+ hours of his podcast and interviews.
  Here are 10 lessons you can use to level up your life:

- Before the lessons,
  Huberman’s resume:
  • Ph.D. in neuroscience
  • Numerous awards and recognitions
  • Professor at Stanford School of Medicine
  • Millions of lives saved and improved
  • 100 million+ YouTube views
  • 6'1" 225 lbs - lean
  He's legit. 
   
- Quick story:
  While shark diving he got caught with no air (airline failed, backup tank empty)
  He had to decide:
  • go for the surface and likely die (no air, shark)
  • wait for a fellow diver to return and share oxygen
  He waited and survived. 
   
- What did he do the next day?
  He got back in the water. 
  Swam with the sharks. 
  Why?
  Because he knows how the brain works. 
  He put himself right back in the same environment to purge the trauma, allowing him to heal. 
  That’s badass. 
  Onto the lessons: 
   
- Hydrate
  You tend to get dehydrated at night.
  • drink 16+ ounces of water
  • add a little sea salt/electrolytes
  "Hydration is essential for mental performance."
  Delay caffeine consumption for 90-120 min. after waking to avoid an afternoon crash. 
   
- Forward Movement
  Optic flow (visual images moving by the eyes) decreases neural activity in the amygdala (reducing anxiety).
  You can:
  • walk
  • run
  • bike
  The goal is to be alert but not anxious, so you can get to work.
  Outside is better than inside so you get... 
   
- Morning Sun
  Sunlight indirectly in your eyes promotes wakefulness.
  It starts a 12-14 hour clock for melatonin release (aiding sleep).
  • no sunglasses
  • contacts/glasses ok
  • a few min. is beneficial
  • don't look directly at the sun
  • if up pre-dawn use artificial light 
   
- Fast
  Delay (most) food until late in the morning.
  Fasting increases norepinephrine improving your ability to focus, learn, and do deep work.
  You can have small amounts of food without breaking the fast, it depends on your insulin sensitivity/recent eating history. 
   
- Deep Work
  Increase alertness:
  • keep your eyes at eye level or above
  • sit (stand) upright
  Focus on work for 90 min.
  • don't use the bathroom if you can
  • turn on white noise
  • avoid distractions
  Timing: begin 2-4 hours after waking
  "Get into a tunnel of quality work." 
   
- Exercise
  Duration: 60+ min.
  Frequency: 5x+/week
  • 50% strength training
  • 50% endurance training
  Adjust the ratio for your goals.
  80% of resistance training below failure
  80% of cardio in zone 2 (be able to talk) 
   
- Nutrition
  Timing: late morning
  Volume: 80% full feeling
  Lunch: protein, vegetables, carbs (only if exercised)
  Dinner: higher ratio of carbs (to aid sleep)
  Make sure you are getting the (micro) nutrients you need.
  Take a brief (5-30 min.) walk outside after eating (if you can). 
   
- Non-Sleep Deep Rest
  Shift your state towards deep relaxation for 10-20 min to improve brain and body function:
  • meditate
  • yoga nidra
  • hypnosis
  • short nap
  Hypnosis has been shown to increase neuroplasticity.
  Afterwards enter another period of deep work. 
   
- Evening routine
  Late afternoon/evening sunlight for 5-30 minutes keeps your melatonin rhythm appropriate. 
  Dinner: include starchy carbohydrates to support serotonin release helping you transition to sleep.
  Dim lights and keep them at eye level or below (if possible). 
   
- Sleep
  Take a:
  • hot shower
  • hot bath
  • sauna
  The heat exposure causes your body to cool itself off faster aiding the transition to sleep.
  Keep the room dark and cool.
  Supplements (check with doc):
  • magnesium (bisglycinate or threonate)
  • apigenin
  • theanine 
   
- That's it!
  This thread was largely based on the below episode that outlines an example of an optimized 24-hour schedule.
  "Adapt and modify in ways that best serve you and your schedule.”

- If you want to dive deeper I highly recommend you check out the Huberman lab podcast:

- At a minimum, you should subscribe to his monthly newsletter, Neural Network. 
  He breaks down these concepts (and more) into easy-to-digest and super actionable protocols. 
  The ROI on this 5 minutes/month is astronomical.
