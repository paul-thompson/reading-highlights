- Duplicate content is content that appears on the Internet in more than one place 
   
- While not technically a penalty, duplicate content can still sometimes impact search engine rankings 
   
- Duplicate content can present three main issues for search engines 
   
- They don't know which version(s) to include/exclude from their indices. 
   
- They don't know whether to direct the link metrics (trust, authority, anchor text, link equity, etc.) to one page, or keep it separated between multiple versions. 
   
- They don't know which version(s) to rank for query results. 
   
- URL parameters, such as click tracking and some analytics code, can cause duplicate content issues. 
   
- Similarly, session IDs are a common duplicate content creator. This occurs when each user that visits a website is assigned a different session ID that is stored in the 
   
- One lesson here is that when possible, it's often beneficial to avoid adding URL parameters or alternate versions of URLs 
   
- 2. HTTP vs. HTTPS or WWW vs. non-WWW pages 
   
- If your site has separate versions at "www.site.com" and "site.com" (with and without the "www" prefix), and the same content lives at both versions, you've effectively created duplicates of each of those pages 
   
- Whenever content on a site can be found at multiple URLs, it should be canonicalized for search engines. 
   
- three main ways to do this: Using a 301 redirect to the correct URL, the rel=canonical attribute, or using the parameter handling tool in Google Search Console. 
   
- 301 redirect 
   
- In many cases, the best way to combat duplicate content is to set up a 301 redirect from the "duplicate" page to the original content page 
   
- Rel="canonical 
   
- The rel=canonical attribute should be added to the HTML head of each duplicate version of a page, with the "URL OF ORIGINAL PAGE" portion above replaced by a link to the original (canonical) page. 
   
- The attribute passes roughly the same amount of link equity (ranking power) as a 301 redirect, and, because it's implemented at the page (instead of server) level, often takes less development time to implement.
