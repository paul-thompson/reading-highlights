- Autofocus on the first field 
   
- Ironically, the fundamental rule of interaction design is: remove interaction. Remove clicks, remove reading, remove waiting, remove thinking. 
   
- Use specialized mobile keyboards 
   
- Fortunately, mobile phones have specialized email entry keyboards showing those characters – but you must label your textbox type=email in HTML 
   
- Validate fields immediately 
   
- it makes sense to validate on blur (that is, when they focus on another field). 
   
- Make labels clickable 
   
- Show password requirements when users are choosing a password 
   
- No user should have to guess at what the password requirements are. Show them when they’re relevant (P.S. And remove them when they’re not). 
   
- Let users see their password 
   
- Use button text to expose the value waiting for users on the other side 
   
- what value awaits a user on the other side? Is it getting my free account set up? Am I 30 seconds away from experiencing the future of work! Tell me, dang it! 
   
- Use different terms for “sign in” and “sign up” 
   
- don’t use, say, “Sign in” and “Sign up” – which requires me to think for half a second whether I want “in” or “up 
   
- Allow easy switching between “sign in” and “sign up” 
   
- Log in with email, not username 
   
- Remember typed values between password attempts 
   
- The “reset password” screen should remember which email you already entered 
   
- Far too often, if you click “Forgot password”, you’ll be forced to re-enter an email you typed just 30 seconds before
