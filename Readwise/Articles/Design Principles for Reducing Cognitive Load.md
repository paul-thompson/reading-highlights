- Every time you visit a website, a process of learning is initiated in the brain 
   
- your brain has to learn how to use the site while keeping track of the reason you came there in the first place 
   
- the catch: the working memory in which this information is processed and stored is limited. Your brain begins to slow down or even abandon the task at hand when it receives more information than it can handle 
   
- What Causes Cognitive Load 
   
- Generally speaking, the causes of cognitive load can be traced back to three main factors 
   
- 1) too many choices, 2) too much thought required, or 3) lack of clarity. 
   
- Methods for Reducing Cognitive Load 
   
- Avoid Unnecessary Elements 
   
- Any element that isn’t helping the user achieve their goal is working against them because they must process it and store it in working memory 
   
- Avoiding excessive colors, imagery, design flourishes, or layouts that don’t add value is crucial.
