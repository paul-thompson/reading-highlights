- When something is described as ambiguous, it means that it is confusing, unclear, or open to different interpretations. 
   
- When faced with choices that have uncertain outcomes, our brains tend to rely on mental shortcuts, which can lead to cognitive biases. 
   
- The ambiguity effect leads us to believe that outcomes with the highest known probability are always the best for the business, but that’s not always true. 
   
- When we avoid options with less information 
   
- when faced with deciding between two possible outcomes — one with a known probability and one with an unknown probability – research shows that we tend to choose the option with the known probability 
   
- n other words, we don’t like to mess around with the unknown, so we avoid it as much as we can. 
   
- The impact of the ambiguity effect 
   
- Since consumers don’t know anything about the unfamiliar brand, they stick with brands they have seen before 
   
- from the business owner’s perspective, you miss out on income for your superior product because the shopper didn’t recognize your brand. 
   
- Tolerance for ambiguity 
   
- we all have different tolerance levels for ambiguity. The report defines tolerance for ambiguity as “the tendency for an individual to perceive ambiguous situations as desirable.” 
   
- People with a low tolerance for ambiguity tend to view uncertain situations as adverse 
   
- How to overcome the ambiguity effect 
   
- Self-reflection can help you figure out where you are on the spectrum of ambiguity tolerance 
   
- Practice mindfulness 
   
- When we can be aware of and regulate our emotions, it becomes easier to recognize the fear of the unknown and separate it from our decision-making processes. 
   
- Make time 
   
- We need enough time to think and weigh out all options to make the best choice. Without that time, our brains will try to take shortcuts that can lead to less-optimal outcomes. 
   
- Get creative 
   
- Instead of getting stuck in a state of fear, research suggests it can be helpful to embrace our creativity when faced with uncertain situations
