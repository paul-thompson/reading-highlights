- One of the best ways to grab attention with your posts or tweets is to include an image. There’s heaps of research that says that having images in your posts helps them stand out to followers. 
   
- You’re essentially leaving money on the table without them, because they turn a regular post with a little ol’ link in it into a post with a big honkin’ attention grabbin’ image on it, with a massive clickable area. 
   
- I love images on social media when they are the human-curated center of content. But I feel like they’ve been hijacked by auto-generated computer imagery serving as attention-grabbing filler more than supportive expression. 
   
- It's kind of genius when you think about it. How do you get millions of third-party websites to start generating content for you so your platform feels more “engaging”? You make it front and center on the platform. 
   
- “Use social share imagery to stand out—like everyone else.”
