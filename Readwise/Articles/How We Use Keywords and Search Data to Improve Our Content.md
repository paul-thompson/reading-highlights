- Check that the problem is something people look for help with online 
   
- If a bill is hard to read, so is a page about how to read your bill. Using keyword data to validate user needs limits our bias towards solving problems with content. 
   
- Find the language of our audience 
   
- Keywords also help us understand when to use jargon rather than avoid it. 
   
- Inform the scope of content 
   
- See the relationship between different information needs 
   
- If two terms are often searched together, we reflect this relationship in our content. 
   
- Improve our pages performance in search engine results
