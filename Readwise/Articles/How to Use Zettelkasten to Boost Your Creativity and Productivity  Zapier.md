- pioneering a productivity system he called [[zettelkasten]]—German for "slip box." 
   
- The Zettelkasten 
   
- Each slip contained a single and complete idea (a concept his followers call "atomicity"). 
   
- An idea might be as short as a simple sentence, or as long as a paragraph—but it had to fit into the space of a zettel, the equivalent of a half-sheet of paper 
   
- Luhmann never suffered from writer's block. Even with a relatively small number of notes, he always had something to start with when undertaking a new project. 
   
- by connecting related notes together, he often had an outline of a project before he started it. 
   
- the costs of jotting down just one well-formed note isn't a deal-breaker. If an idea has value, it will rise to the surface as more related notes emerge. 
   
- relations are key. 
   
- Like synapses between neurons, note links exponentially increase the value of the system. 
   
- His creativity and productivity took place not in his own mind, but in a dialogue between his first and second brains. 
   
- There is no hierarchy in the Zettelkasten, no privileged place, which means it can grow internally without any preconceived scheme 
   
- Taking the Zettelkasten digital 
   
- Zettelkasten is an obvious candidate for digitalization. Robust full-text search, non-hierarchical organization, and access to the notes from anywhere or any device take Luhmann's great idea and make it even more powerful. 
   
- Decisions, decisions 
   
- Idea capture: Can I start a new note with a single click from any device? 
   
- Linking: Can I directly link notes together? Equally important, can I see backlinks— 
   
- Retrieval: Can I find a note easily? Especially when your Zettelkasten includes 500 or more notes, search matters. 
   
- Does the tool you're considering offer reliable full-text search? Boolean search? Saved searches? Text recognition within images? 
   
- Portability: Can I export the data and structure if I need to leave?
