- Familiarity is related to how easy we can process information. We find familiar things easier to process and understand than the unfamiliar 
   
- when we read a statement or message with ease, we tend to feel we’ve heard it before, therefore suggesting that it may be popular 
   
- Our tendency to see difficult-to-process things as being riskier than those easily-understood has a number of product implications.
