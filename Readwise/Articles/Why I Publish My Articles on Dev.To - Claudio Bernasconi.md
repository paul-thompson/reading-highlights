- I stick to my schedule writing a blog post every week. 
   
- My setup is more straight forward. I write content and publish it on my website and people who find it useful can consume it and comment on it. They are visiting my blog with a purpose. 
   
- Pro tip: If you want to cross-post the articles that you published on your personal blog or somewhere else on the internet, make sure to add a statement at the end of your article where this article was originally published. 
   
- It is also important to set the canonical_url in the metadata of your post
