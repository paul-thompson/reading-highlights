- an array method is a method that can be called on an array to perform an action on or with that array. 
   
- .map() 
   
- This array method takes in a function that will be called on each element in a given array and it returns a new set of an array without modifying the original array. 
   
- it helps us create a new set of array based on an existing one. 
   
- .reduce() 
   
- array method that uses an accumulator to reduce all elements in an array to a single value. 
   
- takes in two augments, a callback function and an initial value, performs an action, and returns a single value, the value being any type i.e. object, array, string, intege 
   
- The call back function takes in two parameters namely: accumulator and current value. 
   
- .filter() 
   
- works similar to the way the .map() method works. It filters an array based on if an element in the array, meets the condition passed in the function and then, it returns an array. 
   
- .includes() 
   
- checks if an element exists in a given array and returns a boolean(true or false) 
   
- there are some constraints with regards to the data types that the include method can check for. This is because of the way Javascript treats objects and primitive types.
