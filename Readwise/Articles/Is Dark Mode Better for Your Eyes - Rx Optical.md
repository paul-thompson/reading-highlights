- Readability 
   
- Let’s talk about reading on screens. Black text on a white background is best, since the color properties and light are best suited for the human eye. 
   
- our irises don’t need to open as wide to absorb the white light. That leaves our irises in a neutral position and allows us to see with better clarity. This is especially true when white light is contrasted against black, which absorbs wavelengths instead of reflecting them. 
   
- White text on a black background, or “dark mode,” makes the eye work harder and open wider, since it needs to absorb more light. 
   
- For our e-readers out there, we recommend sticking with “light mode,” or dark text on a light background. 
   
- The jury is still out on whether or not dark mode is better for reducing eye strain, but we can confirm a few things 
   
- Dark mode can reduce eye strain in low-light conditions. 
   
- 100% contrast (white on a black background) can be harder to read and cause more eye strain. 
   
- It can be harder to read long chunks of text with a light-on-dark theme 
   
- In essence, we recommend using a dark theme when you’re in low light or when you don’t plan to read for long periods of time. 
   
- If you do a fair amount of reading, stick to light mode. Even though black text is easier to read, it might be a good idea to try a gray background and control your screen’s brightness
