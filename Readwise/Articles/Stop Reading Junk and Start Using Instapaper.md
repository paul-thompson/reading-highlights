- You are what you read. 
   
- you also want to feed your mind with only high-quality, thoughtful content. 
   
- One killer technique is to use a "read it later" app such as Instapaper, Pocket, Refind, et al. These apps enable you to send articles to a central depository where you can choose to deliberately read them later rather than impulsively reading them on the spot. 
   
- More importantly, and more subtly, read it later apps naturally filter out low-quality articles. 
   
- Instapaper 
   
- Originally released more than a decade ago by the prolific developer, Marco Arment, Instapaper requires no introduction among our audience. 
   
- Instapaper features a remarkably clean, uncluttered reading experience on both desktop and mobile complete with — drumroll please — highlighting! Not just that: Instapaper treats highlighting and note-taking as first-class features 
   
- Instapaper offers an open API enabling you to easily access and put your reading data to use, either on your own or through a third-party app such as Readwise. 
   
- Instapaper & Readwise 
   
- Once you've linked your Instapaper account with Readwise, the notes and highlights you take in Instapaper will be automatically synced with and resurfaced by Readwise with zero effort on your part. 
   
- Better Reading 
   
- The uncluttered reading experience, the noting & highlighting, the open API — these are all wonderful features of Instapaper.
