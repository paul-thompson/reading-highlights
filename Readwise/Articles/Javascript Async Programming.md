- Async functions execute concurrently with the main thread of execution 
   
- it is typical for several async functions to finish their execution in a different order that they are called. 
   
- Callback functions are typically used for control flow for async functions 
   
- Callback functions are functions passed as a parameter to be executed when the high-order function (The function receiving the function parameter) has completed.
