- Overview 
   
- The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target. 
   
- Takeaways 
   
- Touch targets should be large enough for users to accurately select them. 
   
- Touch targets should have ample spacing between them. 
   
- Touch targets should be placed in areas of an interface that allow them to be easily acquired. 
   
- In 1954, psychologist Paul Fitts, examining the human motor system, showed that the time required to move to a target depends on the distance to it, yet relates inversely to its size 
   
- fast movements and small targets result in greater error rates, due to the speed-accuracy trade-off. 
   
- this law influenced the convention of making interactive buttons large (especially on finger-operated mobile devices)—smaller buttons are more difficult (and time-consuming) to click.
