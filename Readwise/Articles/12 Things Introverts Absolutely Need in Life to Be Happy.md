- Our minds process things deeply, and because we’re sensitive to the “feel good” neurotransmitter dopamine, we just don’t get “high” off socializing like extroverts do 
   
- What an Introvert Needs to Be Happy 
   
- Plenty of time to wind down and process 
   
- Because we’re wired to process ideas and events deeply, introverts may get very drained by, say, a stressful day at work, shopping in a crowded mall, or a heated conversation with a significant other 
   
- Meaningful conversation 
   
- if we’re only fed a diet of small talk, we’ll feel like we’re starving. Without those intimate, raw, big-idea moments, we’ll be unhappy. 
   
- Companionable silence 
   
- Without companionable silence, introverts won’t be happy. 
   
- Space to dive deep into our hobbies and interests 
   
- “flow” is a mental state in which a person is fully immersed in an activity and enjoying the process. A flow state comes naturally to many introverts, and without it, we won’t feel happy 
   
- A quiet space that’s all ours 
   
- fully alone, without fear of intrusion or interruption, is invigorating on a near-spiritual level for introverts. 
   
- Time to think 
   
- According to Dr. Marti Olsen Laney in [*The Introvert Advantage*](https://amzn.to/2Jxd5Qi), introverts may rely more on long-term memory than working memory (for extroverts, it’s the opposite). 
   
- Without time to process and reflect, introverts will feel stressed. 
   
- People who understand that sometimes we’ll be staying home 
   
- A deeper purpose to our lives and work 
   
- Permission to remain quiet 
   
- Independence 
   
- We do our best work — and are our happiest — when we have the freedom to explore ideas, spend time alone, and be self-directed and independent. 
   
- The simple life 
   
- the simple life is good enough for me. A good book, a lazy weekend, a meaningful conversation with a friend — and some snuggles from my animal friends — are what makes me happy. 
   
- Friends and loved ones who value us despite our quirks
