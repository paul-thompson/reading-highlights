- The proposition that people rely on mental models was first put forward by the Scottish psychologist Kenneth Craik in 1943 
   
- he wrote that the mind constructs "small-scale models" of reality that it uses to reason, to anticipate events and to underlie explanation. 
   
- According to Johnson-Laird, ambiguous passages of text can lead to more than one competing mental model, which is something authors deliberately use to keep the reader confused about certain aspects of, say, a story in a novel. 
   
- passages of text that unambiguously produce a single mental model are easier to comprehend. 
   
- Relevance for interaction design 
   
- The slower processing of ambiguous sentences is one area where mental model research is relevant to interaction design, as interaction designers are, among other things, interested in measures of learnability and ease of use 
   
- the user develops a mental model of how he/she thinks the system works through interaction of the system. This model is used to reason about the system, to anticipate system behaviour and to explain why the system reacts as it does 
   
- The problem of ensuring that the user's mental model corresponds to the designer's model arises because the designer does not talk directly with the user 
   
- Norman's account is of course an over-simplification, but it captures some central dilemmas of interaction design by using mental models as a vehicle for explanation and illustration. 
   
- This compulsion toward making a mental model of the 'internal logic' of the system may be part of the reason why many efforts in the HCI community in the early 80s were wasted since it appeared that "The aim of interface design was to invent metaphors that users could understand, but which had not much to do with the internal workings of the system" (Andersen, p.4).
