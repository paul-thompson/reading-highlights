- A Simple Format to Get You Out of Your Head and Writing 
   
- A resource round-up: “The Best Resources for Learning Go from Scratch” 
   
- A step-by-step tutorial: “How to Set Up Apollo Server” 
   
- An architecture overview: “How App X Implements the Mediator Pattern” 
   
- A deep dive into a technical concept: “What is Functional Programming?” 
   
- the TIL (Today I Learned) format. Here’s how it goes: whenever you learn something small, just write down the problem that you’ve solved and the solution that you’ve found and publish it 
   
- Platforms: Where to Write 💻 
   
- What’s important when you’re getting started is building the muscle of writing. As you build the habit, you’ll start to learn what’s important to you, like the formatting of the code snippets or the ability to create custom components. 
   
- Hosting Elsewhere 🌐 
   
- Dev.to - Dev.to skyrocketed in popularity when Medium started introducing weird paywall features. It’s a great platform and a friendly community 
   
- Hashnode - Hashnode’s blogging platform has really taken off lately. I like all of the ways they try to engage their community 
   
- Using one of these options will save you the time and headache of maintaining and deploying your own site and just focus on writing. 
   
- Pro tip: If you ever decide to move from one of these platforms to your own site and domain, you can always update the canonical URL to tell search engines that the version on your domain name is the source of truth. 
   
- Writing is a skill that takes practice. The more you write, the better you’ll get at it. This might sound kind of obvious at first, but I think developers often think they should be naturally good at writing words since they are good at writing code 
   
- One of the most helpful concepts I’ve come across is that of a blog as a digital garden. Let go of the idea that you have to ship a perfectly complete blog article. 
   
- You don’t need to be an expert to write about something. In fact, learning in public is a great way to test out ideas and document your progress.
