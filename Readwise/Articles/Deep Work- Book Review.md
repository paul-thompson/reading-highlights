- *Deep Work* is a book on the science of productivity. The author says that you must work deeply- with uninterrupted and high concentration- to succeed in this global economy 
   
- 1. Develop deep work habits 
   
- Our productivity is directly proportional to the intensity of focus and the time we spend at work 
   
- A person with high intensity of focus can get more than a person with low intensity of focus spending the same amount of time. A work done with high intensity of focus is simply deep work. 
   
- cognitively demanding tasks such as solving a complex math problem, writing a story, writing a computer program, etc., when done with very high concentration, is deep work 
   
- Deep work increases our productivity, helps us get more done in less time, helps us get extraordinary results, and also allows us to achieve satisfaction with our work. 
   
- 2. Your attention is limited 
   
- According to Attention Restoration Theory (ART), to concentrate on any work requires directed attention. And directed attention is limited. So, once it gets finished, you would struggle to concentrate. 
   
- Downtime from work is very helpful in increasing your productivity. While shut down, you may spend time with your family, meditate, exercise, or spend time with nature. All of these will help you to recharge your limited directed attention for the next day. This is one of the most powerful lessons from the book *Deep Work.* 
   
- 3. It is okay to get bored
