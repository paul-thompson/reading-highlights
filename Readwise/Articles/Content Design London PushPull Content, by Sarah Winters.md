- Pull content 
   
- When you go to a site – you are ‘pulling’ the content. 
   
- All of that takes effort. All of that means you actually have to do something. That’s ‘pull’ publishing. You are pulling the content to you. 
   
- Push content 
   
- The effort is minimal. Your eyes just happened to hit it. Similarly, if you publish a press release and send it to everyone you know – that’s push publishing 
   
- Pointless content 
   
- sometimes they are picked up and turned into news stories that are pulled by an audience. So push just turned to pull. 
   
- And that’s the trick. Turning push to pull. 
   
- The push: Look at this shiny thing! If you buy it, I will make a stack of cash 
   
- The pull: this shiny thing does this, this and this (and will make your life easier etc) and this is how easy it is to give me money so you can have it. 
   
- give the audience what they want and not what you want to say. 
   
- Vanity publishing 
   
- Push publishing is also known as vanity publishing 
   
- Sometimes you need to know who is on the board of directors. Most of the time, the first thing you need to know is ‘am I on the right site?’ 
   
- All push and no pull usually ends up with low results. 
   
- If you push information to your audience they don’t want, chances are you’ll lose them. 
   
- Love your audience 
   
- use the language your audience is using – that will allow them to find you in the first place 
   
- think of what your audience wants to know first and not what your company thinks it wants to say first (that’s the crux of user-centred content and design – there’s a blog post coming about that soon) 
   
- pull in your audience by making them the centre of your attention: make your content easy to read, payment easy to do and the overall experience a good one
