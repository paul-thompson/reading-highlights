- Not writing tests 
   
- Get used to writing these sooner rather than later. You don’t need to go full Test Driven Development (TDD) but at least be comfortable. 
   
- Not documenting code. 
   
- Coming back to old code is a nightmare without good docs 
   
- Not breaking out common code into a reusable library 
   
- Reusable code is your toolbox, it saves you time, effort and complexity. 
   
- Forgetting to split projects into smaller modules. 
   
- Good organisation is the best way to keep a codebase sensible and manageable, it doesn’t come for free though so you have to work at it. 
   
- Not using external libraries. 
   
- Build on other peoples code and don’t write everything from scratch, this lets you move faster, benefit from others work and you can focus on your core business logic. 
   
- Not using an auto code formatter 
   
- Not automating 
   
- If you've done the same thing 3 times in a short period of time (measured in weeks) then it's time to automate it. 
   
- Summary 
   
- None of these on their own will derail a software project but all of them can add friction to the development process and slow you down.
