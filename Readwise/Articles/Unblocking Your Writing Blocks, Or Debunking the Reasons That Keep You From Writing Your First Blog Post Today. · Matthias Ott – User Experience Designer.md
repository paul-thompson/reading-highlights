- I don’t have a large following or audience. Nobody will read my blog posts anyway. 
   
- we should be looking at how valuable our posts can be for other people 
   
- “Even if only one person learns something from your article, you’ll feel great, and that you’ve contributed — even if just a little bit — to this amazing community that we’re all constantly learning from.”
