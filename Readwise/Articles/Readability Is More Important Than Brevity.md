- brevity is pointless. *Readability* is a lot more important. 
   
- A competent minifier (like [Uglify](https://www.uglifyjs.net/) or [Terser](https://github.com/terser-js/terser)) will make your code tiny. So will gzipping. 
   
- Let technology handle that and focus on code that you can easily read when you (or someone else) comes back to it later. 
   
- Use lots of whitespace. 
   
- Write lots of in-code comments and documentation.
