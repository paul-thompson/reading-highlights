- Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) to get traffic alone can cause pain. Be useful or get off the internet. 
   
- The tech side of SEO 
   
- Page views are a vanity metric 
   
- Accessibility first, please. 
   
- Screen readers can skip down headings but they can’t skim over the page, so your audience won’t know if a page is going to give them the thing they’d like to hear 
   
- Swamp the internet with crap. 
   
- Generally, people go to your site, realise they are not going to get what they want and leave. At best, they won’t take any notice of you. 
   
- Understanding your audience is everything. 
   
- Confab session: SEO and content design 
   
- User experience (UX) is all about the user. 
   
- you can also prioritise the content with the volume that they are using their search terms. 
   
- vanity metrics don’t get long-term gains and can produce inaccessible content, 
   
- we should focus on the audience, not a search engine, 
   
- organisations should use SEO teams (if they have them) at discovery stage 
   
- Every time you publish, add value
