- Summary: What users believe they know about a UI strongly impacts how they use it. 
   
- Mental models are one of the most important concepts in human–computer interaction (HCI) 
   
- A mental model is what the user believes about the system at hand. 
   
- A mental model is based on belief, not facts: that is, it's a model of what users know (or think they know) about a system such as your website. 
   
- Individual users each have their own mental model. A mental model is internal to each user's brain, and different users might construct different mental models of the same user interface. 
   
- Because designers know too much, they form wonderful mental models of their own creations, leading them to believe that each feature is easy to understand. 
   
- Remember Jakob's Law of the Internet User Experience: Users spend most of their time on websites other than yours. Thus a big part of customers' mental models of your site will be influenced by information gleaned from other sites. 
   
- Mixed-Up Mental Models 
   
- Many of the usability problems we observe in studies stem from users having mixed-up mental models that confuse different parts of the system. 
   
- When a website or intranet has several search engines on the same page, users often don't know the difference. 
   
- Through failure after failure, they never question their basic assumptions. This is yet another argument for complying with preexisting user expectations whenever possible 
   
- Acting on Mental Models 
   
- Understanding the concept of mental models can help you make sense of usability problems in your design. 
   
- Make the system conform to users' mental models — assuming most models are similar. 
   
- If people look for something in the wrong place, then move it to the place where they look for it 
   
- Improve users' mental models so that they more accurately reflect your system. You can do this by, for example, explaining things better and making labels clearer to 
   
- Mental models are a key concept in the development of instructions, documentation, tutorials, demos, and other forms of user assistance. 
   
- In any case, simple user testing is certainly the first step to take if you suspect that erroneous mental models are costing you business.
