- Trying to jump on the latest trends. 
   
- Keep changing the thing you’re learning. 
   
- Pick a niche, start from the fundamentals, stay focused. It’s better to know 80% of one language that know 10% of 8 different languages.

- The thing you need to learn is the process, how things work, and how things are built. Then you can use all the books, all the websites, all the search engines to help you figure out the rest. 
   
- Thinking coding is a solitary activity. 
   
- Find a community, make friends, find peers that have the same problems as you. Everyone loves to help each other. Even better is to find someone local to you. It will be more fun!
