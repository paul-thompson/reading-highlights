- it turns out the novel discovery is just a side effect. You don't make novel discoveries by trying to make novel discoveries. 
   
- research is simply a continuation of something we already naturally do: learning. Learning happens when you understand something that someone else already understands. 
   
- Research happens when you understand something that nobody else understands yet. 
   
- Research, I realized, is what happens as a byproduct when you try to understand something and hit the bounds of what humanity currently knows 
   
- When our goal is to understand something, we start getting curious: why does this work this way, and not that way? Why doesn't this do what I expected? 
   
- When we see research as a process of understanding rather than a process of producing novel discoveries, it becomes clear that many curious, bright people who don’t believe they can be researchers already have the foundational skills needed 
   
- At some point, we'll ask questions where nobody has the answer. At that point, we’re starting to do research
