- Flexbox is for one-dimensional layouts - anything that needs to be laid out in a straight line (or in a broken line, which would be a single straight line if they were joined back together). Grid is for two-dimensional layouts. It can be used as a low-powered flexbox substitute (we’re trying to make sure that a single-column/row grid acts very similar to a flexbox), but that’s not using its full power. 
   
- **Grid Lines** are the lines that make up the grid. These can be horizontal or vertical. We can refer to them by number, or by name. 
   
- **Grid Track** is the space between two Grid Lines, either horizontal or vertical 
   
- **Grid Cell** is the space between 4 Grid Lines. So it is the smallest unit on our grid that is available for us to place an item into. Conceptually it is just like a table cell 
   
- A **Grid Area** is any area on the Grid bound by four grid lines. It may contain a number of Grid Cells.
