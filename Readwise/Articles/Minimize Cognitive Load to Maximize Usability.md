- Summary: The total cognitive load, or amount of mental processing power needed to use your site, affects how easily users find content and complete tasks. 
   
- When the amount of information coming in exceeds our ability to handle it, our performance suffers. We may take longer to understand information, miss important details, or even get overwhelmed and abandon the task. 
   
- the cognitive load imposed by a user interface is the amount of mental resources that is required to operate the system. 
   
- Informally, you can think of mental resources as "brain power" â€” more formally, we're talking about slots in working memory 
   
- Intrinsic vs. Extraneous Cognitive Load 
   
- Intrinsic cognitive load is the effort of absorbing that new information and of keeping track of their own goals. 
   
- Designers should, however, strive to eliminate, or at least minimize, extraneous cognitive load: processing that takes up mental resources, but doesn't actually help users understand the content 
   
- Minimizing Cognitive Load 
   
- User attention is a precious resource, and should be allocated accordingly 
   
- Avoid visual clutter: redundant links, irrelevant images, and meaningless typography flourishes slow users down 
   
- meaningful links, images, and typography are valuable design elements; it is only when overused that these backfire and actually impair usability. 
   
- Build on existing mental models: People already have mental models about how websites work, based on their past experiences visiting other sites 
   
- Offload tasks: Look for anything in your design that requires users to read text, remember information, or make a decision. Then look for alternatives: can you show a picture, re-display previously entered information, or set a smart default
