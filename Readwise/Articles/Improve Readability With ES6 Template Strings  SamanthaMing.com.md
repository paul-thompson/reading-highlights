- Improve Readability with ES6 Template Strings 
   
- A better way is to use template strings with backticks ( ` ). 
   
- Improve Readability with String Interpolation 
   
- when you want to include a variable within the strings. No more messy + concatenation. 
   
- const better = `Today is a ${weather} day!`;
