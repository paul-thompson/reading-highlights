- like a teacher, I need to present information in an easily understandable way to new visitors 
   
- A teacher’s responsibility, like a UX designer’s, is to present content in a format known as instructional design 
   
- Teachers, like UX designers, decide which content is relevant and how to visually present it 
   
- Intrinsic Cognitive Load 
   
- “Intrinsic” here refers to the complexity that is inherent in certain tasks or materials. 
   
- Extraneous Cognitive Load 
   
- This form of content consists of superfluous elements, such as an infographic that isn’t necessary for the text it accompanies and that requires the user to do extra mental processing, which can lead to cognitive overload. 
   
- some tips and examples on how to avoid cognitive overload when designing. 
   
- 1. Simplify 
   
- Audit all of your content and remove anything that isn’t absolutely required for your user to realize their goal 
   
- Distractors and extraneous elements will most likely lead not to increased stimulation, but to cognitive overload. 
   
- If the content doesn’t support the instructional goal, then remove it. Use your judgment, and be mindful of branding and design aesthetics that the targeted audience would expect 
   
- 2. Bite-Sized Information 
   
- If the content is too complex and the layout too dense and clustered, then the user might not be able to, or even want to, process the information effectively. 
   
- Breaking complex content into smaller chunks and enabling the user to control their consumption of this content will help them process the information more effectively. 
   
- 3. Be Creative 
   
- Present information in different ways. Because the web is visual, try to present content graphically, through images or graphs. This is a great way to exploit the user’s different processing methods, freeing up their mind as they consume content, which in turn reduces their cognitive load. 
   
- 4. Keep the Story Interesting and Free of Redundancy 
   
- When every page is based on the same template, unique storylines are lost because everything becomes homogenous. 
   
- make high-level pages visually unique, and tell a story from the top of the page to the bottom to capture and hold interest. 
   
- 5. Make It Multimedia 
   
- People learn better when words and graphics are combined — that is, when graphics on their own would not be self-explanatory 
   
- 6. Follow Basic Design Principles 
   
- Make the typography big.
  Choose readable font faces.
  Employ summaries and headings.
  Make the layout clear.
  Use generous white space.
  Clarify with examples.
