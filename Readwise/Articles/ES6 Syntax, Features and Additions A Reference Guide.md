- ECMAScript2015 or ES6 
   
- according to Can I Use, around 90% of all browsers can natively understand ES6 syntax. 
   
- Let & Const 
   
- Both let and const are block-scoped, meaning the variable can be scoped to any block, such as if, for, or while. A var is function-scoped, meaning only functions will introduce a new scope. 
   
- Additionally, neither let nor const can be redeclared once the variable is declared in a scope. 
   
- The difference between let and const is that let can be reassigned and const cannot. 
   
- String 
   
- Template Literals 
   
- Template literals, sometimes referred to as template strings, are a new type of string syntax that allows embedded expressions and multi-line strings 
   
- Instead of concatenating with the string concatenation operator (+), you can embed a variable directly in a string using ${}. 
   
- Instead of concatenating with the string concatenation operator (+), you can embed a variable directly in a string using ${} 
   
- Instead of concatenating with the string concatenation operator (+), 
   
- Note that white space, such as with indentation, is preserved using multi-line strings 
   
- Methods 
   
- Several new String methods were added in ES6: startsWith(), endsWith(), includes(), and repeat() 
   
- We can easily determine if something begins a string using startsWith(). 
   
- We can similarly determine if something ends a string using endsWith() 
   
- String.prototype.includes() 
   
- includes is a particularly helpful addition to the JavaScript language, and allows a very simple and straightforward way to find if a string contains a particular value at any point 
   
- String.prototype.repeat() 
   
- The repeat() method repeats and concatenates a string. 
   
- Functions 
   
- Arrow Functions 
   
- An arrow function expression is a new way to create a function expression in JavaScript.
