- Being a quick learner can give you an even greater edge. Science proves there are six ways you can learn and retain something faster 
   
- Sleeping between two learning sessions greatly improves retention. 
   
- dedicating 30-50 minutes to learning new material. “Anything less than 30 is just not enough, but anything more than 50 is too much information for your brain to take in at one time, 
   
- Brief, frequent learning sessions are much better than longer, infrequent ones, 
   
- He recommends preparing for micro learning sessions. “Make note cards by hand for the more difficult concepts you are trying to master,” he says. “You never know when you’ll have some in-between time to take advantage of.” 
   
- While it’s faster to take notes on a laptop, using a pen and paper will help you learn and comprehend better. 
   
- tendency to transcribe lectures verbatim rather than processing information and reframing it in their own words is detrimental to learning.” 
   
- While it sounds counterintuitive, you can learn faster when you practice distributed learning, or “spacing.” 
   
- To retain material, Carey said it’s best to review the information one to two days after first studying it 
   
- Downtime is important when it comes to retaining what you learn, and getting sleep in between study sessions can boost your recall up to six months later, according to new research published in Psychological Science.

- What we found is if you practice a slightly modified version of a task you want to master,” he writes, “you actually learn more and faster than if you just keep practicing the exact same thing multiple times in a row.”
