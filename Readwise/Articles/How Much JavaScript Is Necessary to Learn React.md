- Object-oriented programming and ES6 class keyword 
   
- Prior to React 16.08, all stateful components in React were created using class-based components and functional components were called stateless functional components 
   
- hooks allows us to create a state on functional components, but as it is a new feature added in the library, it might take time for adoption of this feature. 
   
- All sorts of different methods available 
   
- You should also be able to use different kinds of default methods available for data types like strings and arrays 
   
- Youâ€™ll have to sort, filter, map through a list of items more often than you imagine while building these kinds of applications 
   
- The ones that I recommend are map, filter, reduce, sort, include etc for arrays, split, join, reverse etc for strings 
   
- Promises, callbacks and asynchronous JavaScript 
   
- Asynchronous JavaScript is super important in Single Page Applications. 
   
- Promises provide a way to handle asynchronous code. Callbacks can do that too but Promises make the code a lot cleaner 
   
- Async Await 
   
- Async-await provides a simpler way to interact with promises. 
   
- They make asynchronous code look synchronous and yet, the working is still asynchronous 
   
- Modules, import, export, babel 
   
- When working with React, you isolate your components on separate files 
   
- Babel is a tool that compiles modern JavaScript to JavaScript version supported by all popular browsers
