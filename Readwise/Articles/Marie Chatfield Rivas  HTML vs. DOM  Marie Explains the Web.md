- HTML is a text language that marks up content with structure and meaning. 
   
- each of these element tags can have children, the children may be other HTML elements or it could just be plain text content. 
   
- Document Object Model (DOM) 
   
- internal data structure that the browser maintains and keeps up to date and keeps in sync. 
   
- So we can think of the HTML standard and the DOM standard as essentially like sets of rules. And these rules are going to include things like how do you map between an HTML element and a DOM node? As well as what should each of those elements do? How do they behave? What kinds of properties and attributes can you set on them?
