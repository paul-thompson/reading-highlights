- Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate 
   
- Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate. 
   
- One hour of writing is much more efficient than one hour of "digital thinking" for me. 
   
- much better recall for what I've physically written down than what I've typed. Writing adds "useful friction" to my thinking in the same way that writing code cements learning much better than just copying and pasting. 
   
- journaling keeps me off my phone in the evenings. Usually while I'm watching TV to wind down at night, I have a bad habit of checking my phone and doing the app hamster wheel 
   
- Being Okay with Impermanence 
   
- Ironically, because I had over-optimized this capture step, it became incredibly difficult to clarify, organize, or review any of this data

- Questions to Consider 
   
- Where might you need "useful friction" in your life or work? 
   
- Are you over-complicating any systems? 
   
- What's the nature of your work? What's "deep work" look like for you?
