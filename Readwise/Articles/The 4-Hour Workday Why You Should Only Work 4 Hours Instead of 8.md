- 4 Hour Workday 
   
- The 40-hour work week is a relic from the Industrial Revolution. If you think 8 hours is excruciatingly long, prior to its implementation after the notion of *8-hours work, 8-hours recreation, 8-hours rest* was propagandized by the Labor Union, workers worked as long as 16 hours every day. 
   
- 8 hours seems nonsensical today when manual labor is automated, and work tends to be dominantly cognitive. 
   
- Our mental bandwidth is embarrassingly small and, rather than pushing its limit, we’d be far more efficient if we leveraged it in a period or series of periods as small as possible 
   
- Darwin didn’t toil for 16 hours each day; he achieved these glorious feats by working, as you might have guessed, only 4 hours every day. He worked for two 90-minute periods in the morning and then an additional hour later in the day. 
   
- Focus, Sleep, Repeat 
   
- high-achievers did not work hard, but instead worked smart. They realized that taxing the mind for long hours at a time was counterintuitively unproductive. Rather, they worked when their energy was at its peak or when they felt that they were at their zenith of productivity 
   
- This is the working principle of the 4-hour workday – tremendous, uncompromising focus during only these peak times. 
   
- In fact, writer of *Two Awesome Hours,* Josh Davis, has audaciously claimed that one can do more meaningful work in just two hours when fully focused than in two whole days when semi-focused! 
   
- A lack of sleep beckons stress, one of the potential causes of cancer. According to a study conducted in 2015 involving 600,000 people, those who worked 55 hours or more every week were 33% more likely to suffer a stroke than those who worked 35-40 hours every week 
   
- Basically, squeeze 20-30-minute breaks or power naps between the 90-minute peaks. A brisk walk outside while assimilating the day’s work or listening to music or reading to forget about work for a while is advised 
   
- It is high time we begin to value work over presence.
