- The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document 
   
- The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. 
   
- The principal standardization of the DOM was handled by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which last developed a recommendation in 2004. 
   
- To render a document such as a HTML page, most web browsers use an internal model similar to the DOM 
   
- the DOM does not necessarily need to be represented as a tree, and some browsers have used other internal models.
