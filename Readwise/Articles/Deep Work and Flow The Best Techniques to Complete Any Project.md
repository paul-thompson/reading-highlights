- deep work as the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. 
   
- High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus) 
   
- psychology tells us that deep work is not sufficient for peak performance — you also need flow. 
   
- Deep work is the ability to reach a state of mind in which you can work on a task without any distraction 
   
- Flow, instead, is the cognitive ability to maintain that state 
   
- With deep work, you can master abilities, finish tasks faster, and free up time to use for your pleasures. 
   
- Deep Work and Flow Concept: Two types of problem 
   
- For deep work, the main problem is multitasking and jumping between projects. 
   
- multitasking results in attention residual, which is the inability of our mind to switch between two tasks instantly 
   
- For flow instead, the problem is the mindset since it deals with the inability to track progress, define tasks, and avoid fear breaks 
   
- How to solve the impossibility of going Deep 
   
- the shorter is the task, the smaller is the barrier, and the faster you will reach the deep work state. 
   
- purpose is to speed up the process, divide your projects into daily macro-tasks 
   
- Short deadlines not only make you work harder to finish faster, but they also train you to reach the deep work state constantly 
   
- How to solve the impossibility of keeping Flow 
   
- Flow is only an enhancing function of deep work and, without deep work, flow is useless and unreachable 
   
- Flow helps you to stop procrastinating between projects, or tasks, or unscheduled pauses. 
   
- Make every goal traceable in terms of expected length and completion percentage. For example, write 2 out of 10 pages of a book, or run 2 out of 3 times per week. 
   
- Once you read a goal, you should immediately understand the activity without too much effort. 
   
- A reliable tracking system is fundamental to switch between one task and another, maintaining flow 
   
- The most relevant part of the flow is the ability to match skills with the complexity of the tasks
