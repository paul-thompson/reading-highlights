- Content is so often neglected by product teams and organisations. 
   
- When we work on content, itâ€™s absolutely essential that we have empathy for the users of it. 
   
- The emotional intelligence is two-fold: first, in our understanding of how our users might be arriving at the content, and second, reflecting that back to them with our content.
