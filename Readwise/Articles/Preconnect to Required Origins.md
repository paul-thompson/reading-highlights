- Using preconnect helps the browser prioritize important third-party connections, and speeds up your page load as third-party requests may take a long time to process. 
   
- Basically, third-party requests can slow down page loads for several reasons like slow networks, long DNS lookups, multiple redirects, slow servers, poor performing CDN, etc. 
   
- Using preconnect can significantly speed up page loads in some cases, as the browser spends less time waiting and can start receiving the responses sooner. 
   
- preconnect is useful when you know the origin of the third-party request but don't know what the actual resource itself is 
   
- Use preconnect wisely 
   
- preconnect is only effective for third-party resources and not for resources served from your own host server.
