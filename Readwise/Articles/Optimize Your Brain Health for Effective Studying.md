- What we have found and what countless peer-reviewed studies irrefutably show is that the **very best way to optimize the effectiveness of your studying is to optimize your brain health** 
   
- The right mix of healthy foods can (1) improve energy, (2) sharpen focus, (3) optimize brain health, and (4) generally lift your mood and wellbeing. 
   
- **Lean proteins** like white fish, plain Greek yogurt, beans, peas, lentils, skinned poultry, and eggs 
   
- **Healthy fats** (those omega 3 fatty acids) from avocados, fatty fish like salmon, nuts (particularly walnuts), seeds, and extra-virgin olive oil. 
   
- **Dark, leafy vegetables** like broccoli, spinach, Swiss chard, and kale, which contain vitamins K, B6, and B12 for improved alertness and memory. 
   
- **Complex carbohydrates** like whole-grain bread, brown rice, rolled oats, quinoa, barley, corn, vegetables, and fruits, etc. 
   
- 1.2. Foods and habits to avoid to protect brain health 
   
- *the wrong foods* can make you feel sluggish, fatigued, and forgetful. A diet consistently lacking in [the right nutrients for good brain health](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/foods-linked-to-better-brainpower) can compromise your ability to focus and retain information. 
   
- **Sugar-packed treats:** candy, chocolate, donuts, sodas, energy drinks, and fruit juices 
   
- **Refined carbohydrates:** white bread, chips, fries, and pasta 
   
- **Greasy, fried foods:** fried chicken, hamburgers, pizza, fries, and other deep-fried, greasy, salty, calorie-dense fast foods. 
   
- In a [thesis published by the University of Lethbridge](https://opus.uleth.ca/bitstream/handle/10133/830/Ottewell_Janice_Elaine.pdf) in Canada, it was found that **adequate and regular water** had a positive effect on students' well-being and mood 
   
- Water accelerates the chemical reactions in our bodies. 
   
- Water facilitates the smooth transmission of messaging within the brain and between the brain and the body. 
   
- Water helps to deliver nutrients to our brains to keep it well fed. 
   
- Water helps to flush toxins out of the brain and the body. 
   
- Water helps regulate body temperature. 
   
- **Pro Tip:** Avoid drinking water 90 minutes before going into an exam or bedtime, so you can use the bathroom right before and not worry about bladder distractions 
   
- About 15.5 cups (130 ounces) of fluids a day for men. 
   
- Recharge your brain: The importance of sleep 
   
- A tired brain forgets. 
   
- “First, a healthy amount of sleep is vital for “brain plasticity,” or the brain’s ability to adapt to input. If we sleep too little, we become unable to process what we’ve learned during the day and we have more trouble remembering it in the future. Researchers also believe that sleep may promote the removal of waste products from brain cells—something that seems to occur less efficiently when the brain is awake.” 
   
- chronic sleep deprivation can be linked with depression, high blood pressure, a compromised immune system, and even seizures. 
   
- The wrong study methodology can actually cause insomnia: difficulty falling and/or staying asleep. 
   
- Stop studying at least 30 minutes before your intended bedtime, especially if you’re using your cell phone or laptop to study 
   
- [Low doses of caffeine administered at regular intervals](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/regular-mini-doses-of-caf/) may help you focus better and for longer 
   
- the more [spaced repetitions](https://www.brainscape.com/spaced-repetition) the better 
   
- **Pro tip:** If you need a quick knowledge refresher, try sitting down to a 10-minute Brainscape study session later in the evening. Research shows that knowledge fresh in your brain at bedtime is [more likely to be consolidated](https://www.brainscape.com/academy/best-time-of-day-to-study/) into long-term memory while you sleep 
   
- “First, [exercise] optimizes your mind-set to improve alertness, attention, and motivation; second, it prepares and encourages nerve cells to bind to one another, which is the cellular basis for logging in new information; and third, it spurs the development of new nerve cells from stem cells in the hippocampus. 
   
- The Feynman Technique (1) reinforces your knowledge by freely recalling the information and “teaching it” to an imaginary child, and (2) identifies areas in which your knowledge is shaky or propped up by assumptions.
