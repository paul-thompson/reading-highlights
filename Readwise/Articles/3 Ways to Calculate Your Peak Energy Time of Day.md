- **Takeaway:**You should work around your energy levels; working on more important tasks when you have the most energy, and less productive tasks when your energy dips 
   
- Here are the best methods, inspired largely by Dan Pink’s fantastic book, *[When](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0735210624/?tag=aloproductivity-20)* 
   
- Think about a free day—the weekend, or a weekday when you don’t have much to do that day or the next. Ask: when do you usually go to sleep on these days? When do you wake up? Finally, what’s the midpoint of those two times? (E.g. I go to sleep at 11 p.m. and wake up at 7 a.m., so my midpoint is 3 a.m.) Find where your midpoint lies on the chart below 
   
- **Easy, but less accurate.** Ask yourself what time you wake up on weekends (or free days). If it’s the same as weekdays, you’re likely an early riser. If it’s a little later, you’re probably somewhere in the middle 
   
- **Difficult, but most accurate.** Chart your energy levels. I recommend collecting data every hour, for two or three weeks, so you can find a general pattern. 
   
- **Block off that time in your calendar.** I like to block off 10 a.m.-noon in my calendar most days (this is when my energy peaks). When you block off your peak energy time in your calendar, people will just assume you have meetings or other important commitments during that time, and are unlikely to ask for your time then. 
   
- **Take advantage of energy dips by doing creative work.** You’re more creative when you have the least energy, because your brain is less inhibited, and doesn’t hold back on the ideas it generates 
   
- **Work out, take a break, and clear your mind when your energy dips.** This way you can further build up how much energy you have in your focus hours. 
   
- As Dan puts it: “I used to believe in ignoring the waves of the day. Now I believe in surfing them.”
