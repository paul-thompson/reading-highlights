- Lazy loading improves your site performance, limits bandwidth usage, and even gives your siteâ€™s SEO a boost. 
   
- What is lazy loading? 
   
- Lazy loading is a technique used by web pages to optimize load time 
   
- Lazy loading reduces the time it takes for a web page to open because the browser only loads a fraction of the content on the page at a time. 
   
- The process is called "lazy" because it delays loading until needed 
   
- Google Images implements lazy loading instead. For hidden content, it loads placeholder images to substitute the actual images 
   
- What is eager loading? 
   
- Eager loading is the opposite of lazy loading. With eager loading, a web page loads all of its content immediately. 
   
- Lazy Loading vs. Eager Loading 
   
- Lazy loading is a great option for large page files with more content. However, simpler pages with a set amount of text and few images and/or videos should apply eager loading.
