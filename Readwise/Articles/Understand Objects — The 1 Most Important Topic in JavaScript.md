- JavaScript's fundamental datatype is the object. An object is a composite value that aggregates multiple values. It can hold primitive values and other objects. 
   
- An object allows you to store and retrieve those values by name (the key). An array is an ordered collection, whereas an object is an unordered collection of properties. 
   
- Understand Objects by a Simple Example 
   
- One Last Thing to Know about Objects in General 
   
- Objects are stored into variables as references. 
   
- Primitives (number, boolean, etc.) are stored as values. 
   
- Properties are the Character of An Object 
   
- Each property has a name and a value 
   
- Methods are the Abilities of An Object 
   
- Prototypical Inheritance Is Very Important 
   
- An object is more than a simple string-to-value map. 
   
- In addition to maintaining its own set of properties, an object also inherits the properties of another object — known as a prototype 
   
- Methods of an object are typically inherited properties. "prototypal inheritance" is a crucial feature of JavaScript.
