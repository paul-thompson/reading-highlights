- learning new things is hard 
   
- First, you start out in the developing stage. You’re still acquiring knowledge - maybe you’ve done a few tutorials. But you don’t have a lot of practice under your belt yet 
   
- Once you’ve practiced some more, you move on to the competence stage. This is when you start to “get” it 
   
- You can do the thing, but it still requires conscious effort, or extra supports like checklists or cheat sheets. 
   
- If you practice even more, eventually you reach the mastery stage. This is when you’ve developed deep expertise in a subject. 
   
- you can do the thing without consciously thinking about it. In other words, you’ve developed automaticity (meaning you can do it automatically). 
   
- Tips to Maximize Learning 
   
- combination of retrieval practice and feedback-driven metacognition. Basically, trying to remember things that you’ve learned, and then checking your answers to see if you were right. 
   
- Retrieval Practice 
   
- “The limiting factor for long-term memory is not retention (what is stored) but recall (what can be accessed).” 
   
- Retrieval practice, on the other hand, is all about trying to get information out of your brain. Which is ultimately the skill you want to practice, 
   
- Your brain has two different kinds of memory: working memory (also called short-term memory) and long-term memory. 
   
- You can think of your working memory as a backpack, where you hold onto the memory books you’re currently working with 
   
- It’s quick to access, but it’s not very big, so it can only hold a few things at a time. 
   
- Your long-term memory is like a bookshelf. You can store a lot more information there, but it’s a bit slower to access, because it takes some time to find the book you’re looking for. 
   
- Retrieval practice is the act of deliberately pulling information out of your long-term memory and back into your working memory. 
   
- Studies have shown that using retrieval practice leads to better long-term retention of information than cramming or rereading. 
   
- studies have also shown that the more challenging something is to learn, the better it is for long-term learning.
