- Blogs make having a simple website much easier, and as a result, the number of people who write for the Web has exploded 
   
- Usability Issues 
   
- No Author Biographies 
   
- the basic rationale for "about us" translates directly into the need for an "about me" page on a weblog: users want to know who they're dealing with. 
   
- It's a simple matter of trust. 
   
- readers will trust you more if you're honest about that fact, set forth your informal experience, and explain the reason for your enthusiasm.) 
   
- No Author Photo 
   
- Even weblogs that provide author bios often omit the author photo. 
   
- It offers a more personable impression of the author. 
   
- It connects the virtual and physical worlds. People who've met you before will recognize your photo, and people who've read your site will recognize you when you meet in person 
   
- A huge percentage of the human brain is dedicated to remembering and recognizing faces. For many, faces work better than names 
   
- Nondescript Posting Titles 
   
- even though weblogs are native to the Web, authors rarely follow the guidelines for writing for the Web in terms of making content scannable 
   
- Users must be able to grasp the gist of an article by reading its headline. 
   
- Your posting's title is microcontent and you should treat it as a writing project in its own right. On a value-per-word basis, headline writing is the most important writing you do 
   
- Descriptive headlines are especially important for representing your weblog in search engines, newsfeeds (RSS), and other external environments. 
   
- I noticed several headlines in ALL CAPS. That's always bad. Reading speed is reduced by 10% and users are put off by the appearance of shouting 
   
- Links Don't Say Where They Go 
   
- Remember one of the basics of the Web: Life is too short to click on an unknown 
   
- Tell people where they're going and what they'll find at the other end of the link. 
   
- Classic Hits are Buried 
   
- Highlight a few evergreens in your navigation system and link directly to them.
