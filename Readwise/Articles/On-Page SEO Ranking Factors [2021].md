- Title tags are the second most important on-page factor for SEO, after content. 
   
- Along with smart internal linking, SEOs should make sure that the category hierarchy of the given website is reflected in URLs. 
   
- http://www.example.org/games/v... 
   
- Due to the hierarchy, the engines can deduce that the page likely doesn’t pertain to history in general but rather to that of the history of video games. This makes it an ideal candidate for search results related to video game history. 
   
- URL structure is important because it helps the search engines to understand relative importance and adds a helpful relevancy metric to the given page. 
   
- Content pages are the meat of websites and are almost always the reason visitors come to a site. Ideal content pages should be very specific to a given topic—usually a product or an object—and be hyper-relevant. 
   
- The purpose of the given web page should be directly stated 
   
- Title tag
  URL

  Specify subject several times throughout text content 
   
- Provide unique content about a given subject 
   
- Link back to its category page

  Link back to its homepage (normally accomplished with an image link showing the website logo on the top left of a page) 
   
- On-page SEO refers to the SEO elements you control on the webpage, or the webpage code, itself. Examples of on-page SEO include content, headlines and headers, image optimization, title tags, meta descriptions, structured data, and more.
