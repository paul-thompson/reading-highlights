- designing around a huge set of unknowns, and really embracing that notion as a strength of the web rather than a weakness or unfortunate truth we have to work around. 
   
- A recurring theme is the idea that content (certainly an unknown, since content changes) can and should drive design decisions 
   
- We canâ€™t design the same way we have for this ever-changing landscape, but we can design for content. 
   
- By putting content first and allowing that content to adapt to whatever space surrounds it, we can create more robust, flexible designs that increase the longevity of our products
