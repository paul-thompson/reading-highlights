- So little time, and yet, we waste a lot of energy on low leverage tasks that leave us tired and dissatisfied. We confuse hard work for high-leverage work 
   
- Instead of moving the needle, you want to operate the most efficient levers. Moving the needle may imply a corresponding level of hard work; which is not the case with high-leverage activities. This is the basic principle of leverage: using a lever amplifies your input to provide a greater output. Good levers work as energy multipliers. 
   
- Here are ten examples of high-leverage activities you could experiment with:
  • Automating part of your work
  • Creating and publishing original content
  • Joining a public speaking club
  • Taking a writing workshop
  • Mastering a critical tool
  • Building [metacognitive processes](https://nesslabs.com/metacognition)
  • Learning a new language (including how to code)
  • Looking for a great coach or a great mentor
  • Pushing back on unnecessary (-ly long) meetings
  • Investing in personal and professional relationships 
   
- the aim is to better optimise your resources to focus on work that goes beyond moving the needle. In order to identify these high-leverage activities, you need to reflect on how you allocate your resources 
   
- Focus on activities with oversized output compared to your input. Learn to delegate. Invest in yourself, your systems, and your relationships. While we all have an absolute limit on time, high-leverage activities can multiply our energy.
