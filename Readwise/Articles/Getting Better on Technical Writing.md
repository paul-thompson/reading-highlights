- Consistency is the absence of contradiction. Whenever you conclude a write-up, it is imperative to go proofread it while checking for inconsistencies 
   
- make sure to not mix British and American English in your write-up. 
   
- Sticking to a particular tone throughout your write-up is also important. When writing about personal experiences or opinionated contents, use “I.” 
   
- When writing tutorial guides, use “You,” or “We” if you want the reader to feel held and guided. 
   
- Technical documentations, manuals and some technical articles must be written without these pronouns. 
   
- Paragraph Consistency 
   
- Its unprofessional to raise two points in one paragraph and another point in a third paragraph. 
   
- Start with a sentence that introduces everything your paragraph is going to say. 
   
- Keep sentences short, and free of unnecessary contents. 
   
- Having 2 - 3 sentences or paragraph is great, although some paragraphs might be occasionally longer. 
   
- Style Consistency 
   
- Whichever writing style you adopt, make sure to stick to it. 
   
- Consistency in Formatting 
   
- Preserve whichever formatting pattern you adopt throughout your write-up. If you use numbers for itemizing, don't switch to bullet points. 
   
- Conclusion 
   
- If your message is technically perfect, it is sometimes a fair trade off for grammar and structure.
