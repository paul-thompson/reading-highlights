- Why do tables matter? 
   
- they are the most efficient way to organize complex information in a digestible manner. A well-thought-out table interaction experience in enterprise software design can enhance clarity, ease users’ lives and maximize the data’s potential. 
   
- Things to consider 
   
- What type of data will be contained in the cells? 
   
- your data is mainly composed of short numerical strings like dates and amounts, or if it might contain more complex data like paragraphs of text, links and files. 
   
- What is the user’s intended use for this table? 
   
- Which types of devices will the table be viewed on? 
   
- The interaction experience can vary greatly between a mobile device and a large desktop monitor. 
   
- Does the table need to be actionable by the user? 
   
- Should the table offer customizable viewing options? 
   
- shapes; searching, filtering, sorting, adjusting the display density, etc.
