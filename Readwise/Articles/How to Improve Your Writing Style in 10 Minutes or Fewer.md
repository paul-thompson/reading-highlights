- Use Straightforward Language 
   
- The most fundamental way to simplify writing is to use simpler words 
   
- complicated words have more specific meanings. 
   
- Trim Long Sentences 
   
- One way to make your writing clearer is to limit the use of long sentences. 
   
- Using shorter sentences does not mean that all sentences should be short. This would create a choppy style and is precisely where the art of writing comes into play 
   
- Avoid Redundancies 
   
- Redundant words or phrases are those that can be eliminated without changing the meaning of the sentence 
   
- Cut Excessive Qualification. 
   
- Excessive qualification makes you sound hesitant and adds bulk without adding substance. 
   
- Avoid Needless Self-Reference. 
   
- Favor Active Voice. 
   
- active voice is stronger than passive voice because the active voice is more direct and cuts down on the number of needed words 
   
- Favor Verbs, Not Nouns. 
   
- Nominalizations make sentences weaker (and, usually, longer). 
   
- Use Parallel Forms. 
   
- Parallelism in writing means expressing similar parts of a sentence in a consistent way. 
   
- Be Specific. 
   
- Vague language weakens your writing because it forces the reader to guess at what you mean 
   
- Avoid the Masculine Generic. 
   
- The masculine generic refers to the sole use of the pronoun he or him when referring to situations involving both genders
