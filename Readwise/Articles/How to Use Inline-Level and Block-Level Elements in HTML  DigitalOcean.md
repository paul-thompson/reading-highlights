- Inline elements are elements whose horizontal width is determined by the width of the content they contain 
   
- inline elements do not take up their own line of horizontal space. Thus, inline elements will rest side by side on a webpage 
   
- Block-level Elements 
   
- take up an entire line of horizontal space on a webpage. This means that they automatically start on a new line and that they automatically push subsequent elements onto a new line as well.
