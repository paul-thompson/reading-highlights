- Businesses of all sizes must be able to effectively prioritize focus, energy, and expense towards areas that have the most potential impact. 
   
- Consistently and quickly identifying and optimizing your most valuable pages (MVPs) is a skill that requires ongoing attention, and is too frequently overlooked. 
   
- What are “Most Valuable Pages” (MVPs)? 
   
- MVPs are the pages or sections of your website that have the greatest business impact 
   
- this is something you can discover with content gap analysis and ongoing website expansion driven by key data sets. 
   
- For non-ecommerce websites, MVPs would traditionally include pages such as 
   
- Home page.
  About us.
  Core service pages.
  Location destination pages.
  Core expertise pages (white papers, guides, informational resources required in the conversation journey).
  Demo or offer pages. 
   
- For ecommerce sites 
   
- there would be added emphasis on core commercial intent and revenue-driving areas of the site imperative for income. 
   
- help move people through the information-seeking and buying funnel. 
   
- How to Decide Which MVPs to Focus On 
   
- MVPs must be closely aligned to your business objectives and how that translates online 
   
- If you are looking for brand exposure, your most valuable pages would be very different than a revenue-driven set of objectives. 
   
- suggest looking at the reporting you currently focus on (online and offline), and what measurements are consistently emphasized to review progress in your organization. 
   
- How to Find MVPs 
   
- For visibility metrics such as online impressions, click-through rates, search volume, clicks, and other areas like an average page or term rank, Google Search Console is a useful tool to use. 
   
- For post-click data such as traffic, website events, goal completions, purchases, bounce rates, and more, then Google Analytics is often the main go-to. 
   
- plenty of other tools for more specific tasks tied to MVP selection, such as competitor comparison, backlink growth, and other areas like user experience 
   
- Ahrefs and Semrush are good starting points if you need to expand your data collection. 
   
- Optimizing Your Most Valuable Pages 
   
- the type of optimization activity you pursue is closely matched to the intended gains you set out to achieve, the overriding purpose of the page or content in question, plus other factors like the marketing channel being deployed. 
   
- With each channel, there are associated traditional and fundamental optimization tactics required. 
   
- Example MVP Optimization – Home Page 
   
- Initially (pre-optimization), you will need to decide on the role and function that you need to maximize for the page to be benchmarked and progressed against. 
   
- Grow and establish awareness of the site for brand and catch-all (and often newer/smaller) topics 
   
- Metrics include: impressions, average page and key terms rank, CTR, visits. 
   
- Drive users to commercial impact pages 
   
- Metrics include bounce rate, pages per visit, time on page, events (such as click events from calls to action). 
   
- User experience/usability. 
   
- Metrics include Core Web Vitals, exit rate, and related items mentioned above. 
   
- Establish trust, expertise, and authority 
   
- Metrics include time on page, pages viewed, event clicks, key page interaction. 
   
- Sell/promote high ROI products and services. 
   
- Metrics include traffic, revenue, transactions, clicks to converting pages, and ideal user journey entry/progression. 
   
- As always, before making any changes you need to ensure you have the necessary data in place to support any hypothesis testing or experience-led updates 
   
- Elements you will want to dedicate time and resource on for the home page could include 
   
- Organic and paid adverts.
  On page headings.
  Pre-scroll content.
  CTAs.
  Content hierarchy.
  Content freshness and depth.
  Trust signals, reviews, testimonials, case studies, social proof, and validation.
  Page interaction.
  Navigation (main/sub).
  Visual content (placement, use, variation, content types). 
   
- MVPs as an Ongoing and Iterative Approach 
   
- MVPs should form an always-on part of your digital marketing strategy. 
   
- If it’s not possible to have some degree of monthly MVP inclusion in the marketing plan, you will want to ensure basic (quick/simple) checks are made on the performance against expectations so that data changes are not overlooked regardless of active focus on these pages. 
   
- In Summary 
   
- It’s most effective to have an always-on approach to optimizing your most valuable pages (MVPs)
