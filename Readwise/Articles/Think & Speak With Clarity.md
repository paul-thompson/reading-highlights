- One Question 
   
- Ask yourself, “What is the one single thing I want my audience to take away from my presentation?” 
   
- Got fear? Lower the performance pressure 
   
- “Writer’s block does not exist. Writer’s block is almost like the equivalent of impotence. It’s performance pressure you put on yourself that keeps you from doing something you naturally should be able to do.” 
   
- The anxiety you feel when public speaking is the result of extraordinary amounts of self-pressure that you’ve applied on yourself. 
   
- Clear Communication Starts with Clear Thinking 
   
- Start with - what do you want your audience to think, feel or do differently as a result of your presentation? 
   
- what are the questions they would have? What are the objections they might raise? List all of the questions out on a piece of paper 
   
- arrange those questions in a logical manner.
