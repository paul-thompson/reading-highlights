- By default, most Web servers return a simple "404 Not Found" error message when they get a request for a URL that they don't have. 
   
- This error message violates the three basic guidelines for error messages 
   
- written in plain language that is easy to understand for non-technical users and that does not imply that the mistake is the user's fault 
   
- precise in specifying exactly what was done wrong (that is, not be generic or vague) 
   
- constructive in suggesting steps the user can take to correct the problem 
   
- it would be better to explain to the user why the URL could not be found. It would be even better to list the most common mistakes in accessing files on the given site 
   
- Even better: provide a constructive error message by having the server perform a spelling check on any erroneous URLs to see if they are a close match for valid URLs 
   
- Tobias Ratschiller reports that it reduced the number of 404-errors by at least 40% when spelling check for failed URLs was added to a site with hotel homepages.
