- the sentence is perhaps our strongest way to share a single thought 
   
- What is a sentence? 
   
- a sentence is a string of words used to express a complete thought. 
   
- the central rule is that it must contain both a subject and a verb—and even that rule is bendable for imperative sentences 
   
- Let’s start with the four main types of sentences 
   
- 1 Declarative (statement): This is a standard sentence that points out a fact 
   
- 2 Interrogative (question): This is a sentence asking a question. 
   
- 3 Exclamatory (exclamation): This is a modified declarative sentence used to add emphasis or show emotion, urgency, or high volume. 
   
- 4 Imperative (command): This is a sentence telling someone or something to do an action. The subject is assumed, so you don’t need to include it. 
   
- Declarative sentences use periods 
   
- interrogative sentences use question marks 
   
- exclamatory sentences use exclamation points 
   
- imperative sentences can use either periods or exclamation points. 
   
- A clause is a group of words that contains a subject and verb (except for some imperative clauses) and can be either independent or subordinate 
   
- Sentence rules and structures 
   
- An independent clause can exist as a complete sentence on its own, whereas a subordinate or “dependent” clause can not. 
   
- subordinate clauses must be joined to an independent clause. 
   
- To build sentences, you can use an independent clause by itself or combine it with a subordinating clause, another independent clause, or both. 
   
- Simple sentence structure 
   
- a simple sentence can contain two subjects or two verbs, but not two of each. 
   
- Complex sentence structure 
   
- A complex sentence combines an independent clause with one or more subordinate clauses. 
   
- Complex sentences always use subordinating conjunctions to connect the clauses. 
   
- Compound sentence structure 
   
- A compound sentence combines two independent clauses using a coordinating conjunction 
   
- It’s essentially two simple sentences joined together. 
   
- Compound-complex sentence structure 
   
- Lastly, a compound-complex sentence has at least two independent clauses and at least one subordinate clause 
   
- 5 common sentence mistakes 
   
- Run-ons 
   
- Also known as “fused sentences,” run-on sentences occur when clauses are mashed together without the proper connecting words. 
   
- To fix a run-on sentence, you can simply apply the right conjunctions 
   
- If the sentence still seems awkward or too long, try breaking it up into two or more sentences 
   
- Sentence fragments 
   
- Sentence fragments occur when a sentence is incomplete—if it lacks a subject or a verb, or if it’s a subordinating clause by itself 
   
- To fix a sentence fragment, just identify what’s left out and add the missing part. 
   
- Subject-verb agreement 
   
- In English, if the subject is singular, the verb must also be singular; if the subject is plural, the verb must also be plural. 
   
- Ending with preposition
