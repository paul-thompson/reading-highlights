- It’s a bit like solving puzzles 
   
- You have 
   
- a goal
  some rules about how you can achieve your goal
  a few obstacles you’ll have to overcome to get there 
   
- There’s no substitute for due diligence 
   
- Nothing works without empathy
  Our mantra is ‘user needs first’. 
   
- You need to take a step back and put yourself in other people’s shoes. You need to see things from their point of view, and use any empirical evidence you’ve gathered about this to inform everything you do.
