- As content designers, we cannot really work without user research. Otherwise, it’s like playing chess without the board 
   
- mental model is an explanation of how a person thinks something works. Mental models are based on past experiences, and they shape how someone acts and behaves in future situations 
   
- Researching mental models 
   
- Desk research is something you can do on your own, without directly involving users 
   
- looking at social media to see what people say and how they behave 
   
- doing keyword research to see the language and terms people use 
   
- reading around the topic 
   
- Field research is where you involve users directly in your work 
   
- • card sorting, where users show you how they group or categorise information,
  • diary studies to see users’ thoughts and feelings,
  • interviews to hear first hand about their experiences,
  • observational research, where you can watch and learn how users do a thing,
  • surveys to gather thoughts on specific topics,
  • usability testing, where users talk aloud as they complete a task. 
   
- Reflect your user's mental model 
   
- Rebut the mental model and re-educate your user 
   
- There may be times where you need to rebut a user’s mental model; essentially oppose and re-educate them to help them find, do or get something.
