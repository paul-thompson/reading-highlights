- Laggy websites suck. The amount of suckiness started to really be quantified in the late 70s. 
   
- At IBM, Walter Doherty noticed a beautiful consequence from the improve performance â€” a massive increase in productivity 
   
- It turns out that the time the computer took to process a request was highly correlated with the user response time (the time it took the user to type in the next command). 
   
- Doherty suspected that was happening because a user was storing the series of steps he wanted to take in his working memory. 
   
- The conclusion here is that computer response times make a disproportionate impact on productivity. Your goal should be to get response times under 400ms
