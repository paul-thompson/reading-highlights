- I’ve come to appreciate that unless you’re a full-time content creator who can devote hours to polishing, the only way to publish regularly is by embracing the approach of ”[working with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up)” or ”[learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/)“. [Show Your Work!](https://rachsmith.com/thoughts-on-show-your-work-by-austin-kleon/) as [Austin Kleon](http://austinkleon.com/) says. 
   
- A way to rise to this challenge is to work on the skill of abstracting something more generic/simple from your complex work situation. A “minimal, reproducible example” via blog post if you will.
