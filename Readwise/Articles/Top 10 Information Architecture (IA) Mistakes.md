- Summary 
   
- Structure and navigation must support each other and integrate with search and across subsites. 
   
- Complexity, inconsistency, hidden options, and clumsy UI mechanics prevent users from finding what they need 
   
- The invisible way the site is structured and the visible way users understand and manage that structure. 
   
- Structure Mistakes 
   
- No Structure 
   
- The most notable structural problem is when designers treat a site like one big swamp with no organizing principle for individual items. 
   
- Search and Structure Not Integrated 
   
- We've long known that users often exhibit search-dominant behaviors. This doesn't mean that search is all they need, 
   
- Of course, local navigation works only if the site has a structure to define its neighborhoods 
   
- Sadly, search and navigation fail to support each other on many sites. This problem is exacerbated by another common mistake: navigation designs that don't indicate the user's current location. 
   
- Missing Category Landing Pages 
   
- We recommend that sites have a series of categories that each link to their own landing page that gives users a section overview. 
   
- when no page is clearly identified as a sub-topic page, users can misunderstand the site's scope and miss important details, products, and services. 
   
- Category pages also help SEO because they're the most prominent landing place when people search for a type of product, service, or information 
   
- Breadcrumbs facilitate users' ability to easily move up the levels.) 
   
- Extreme Polyhierarchy 
   
- polyhierarchy can easily become a crutch. Rather than spend time upfront to develop several intuitive and logical top-level categories, teams rush through this important process, creating numerous weak categories and listing products multiple times within them. The usability impact? 
   
- Subsites/Microsites Poorly Integrated with Main Site 
   
- Web design is design for the ages. Think about how anything you do will feel in 5 years. 
   
- we often see product-specific pages that fail to link to information about the company or organization behind the offering. 
   
- Navigation Mistakes
