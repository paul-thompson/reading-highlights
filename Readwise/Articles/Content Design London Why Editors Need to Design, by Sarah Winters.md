- First 5 seconds 
   
- I heard an old saying years ago when I worked in advertising: “You have 5 seconds to get my attention, and 11 to keep it.” 
   
- Tell a story in subheads 
   
- You break up a page with subheads 
   
- Your audience should be able to skim down the page and get an idea of what they are going to get. 
   
- A new study shows when you blink, it’s not just to keep your eyeballs wet. It may be that blinking helps the brain to process information 
   
- Pictures speak a thousand words 
   
- if you can use a picture to get the information across – particularly complex information – more quickly, then consider using it. 
   
- Tools, calculators and calendars can save a thousand words 
   
- Our design principles are as much about words as design and can be applied to most of the sites we see every day. 
   
- Your audience 
   
- You may not design the page but you can design pages to help people read, consume and remember the information 
   
- Content design 
   
- We don’t just write words, we look at all elements on the page and display them in the best way possible for the audience.
