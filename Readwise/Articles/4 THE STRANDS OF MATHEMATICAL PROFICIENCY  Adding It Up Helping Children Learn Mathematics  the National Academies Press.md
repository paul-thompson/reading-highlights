- procedural fluency 
   
- skill in carrying out procedures flexibly, accurately, efficiently, and appropriately 
   
- conceptual understanding 
   
- comprehension of mathematical concepts, operations, and relations 
   
- strategic competence 
   
- ability to formulate, represent, and solve mathematical problems 
   
- adaptive reasoning 
   
- capacity for logical thought, reflection, explanation, and justification 
   
- productive disposition 
   
- habitual inclination to see mathematics as sensible, useful, and worthwhile, coupled with a belief in diligence and oneâ€™s own efficacy. 
   
- Procedural Fluency 
   
- written procedures, mental methods for finding certain sums, differences, products, or quotients, as well as methods that use calculators, computers, or manipulative materials such as blocks, counters, or beads. 
   
- Procedural fluency refers to knowledge of procedures, knowledge of when and how to use them appropriately, and skill in performing them flexibly, accurately, and efficiently. 
   
- Connected with procedural fluency is knowledge of ways to estimate the result of a procedure. 
   
- In addition to providing tools for computing, some algorithms are important as concepts in their own right, which again illustrates the link between conceptual understanding and procedural fluency. 
   
- It is important for computational procedures to be efficient, to be used accurately, and to result in correct answers. Both accuracy and efficiency can be improved with practice
