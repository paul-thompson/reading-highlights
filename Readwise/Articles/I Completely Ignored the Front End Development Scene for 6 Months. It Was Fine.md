- The hectic pace of needing to learn one thing after the next didn't bother me so much because when I was 26 because I was quite happy to spend much of my free time outside of my day job coding. 
   
- There was a time when I would have thought that taking such a break from Front End wasn’t possible. That I had to be aware of all the new frameworks and language features to keep my career on track 
   
- the number of languages I’ve learned or the specific frameworks I’ve gained experience with matters very little. What actually matters is my ability to up-skill quickly and effectively 
   
- What has contributed to my success is the willingness to learn new tools as the need arises. 
   
- learning how you best learn, and 
   
- practicing effectively communicating the things you've learned 
   
- each time I pick up something new I further my expertise in being a lifelong learner. I wouldn't trade that experience for anything.
