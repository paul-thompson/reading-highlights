- ask a random programmer when they do their best work and there's a high chance they will admit to a lot of late nights. Some earlier, some later. A popular trend is to get up at 4am and get some work done before the day's craziness begins. Others like going to bed at 4am. 
   
- the gist of all this is avoiding distractions. But you could just lock the door, what's so special about the night? 
   
- I think it boils down to three things: the maker's schedule, the sleepy brain and bright computer screens 
   
- But even programmers should be sleeping at night. We are not some race of super humans 
   
- when your brain is tired it has to focus! There isn't enough left-over brainpower to afford losing concentration. 
   
- To conclude, programmers work at night because it doesn't impose a time limit on when you have to stop working, which gives you a more relaxed approach, your brain doesn't keep looking for distractions and a bright screen keeps you awake.
