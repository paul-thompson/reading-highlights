- What is CUBE CSS? 
   
- CUBE stands for Composition Utility Block Exception, and CSS stands for, y’know, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). 
   
- The core of this methodology is that most of the work is already done for you with global and high-level styles 
   
- CUBE CSS in essence, is a progressive enhancement approach, vs a fight against the grain of CSS or a pixel-pushing your project to within an inch of its life approach. 
   
- Composition 
   
- the LEGO blocks analogy isn’t that relevant in the wider context of design systems. It is very useful at explaining a component’s role in an overall project, though. 
   
- wider composition often trumps micro-optimisations and the composition layer of CUBE CSS exists because of this 
   
- Think of the composition as a skeleton. 
   
- Composition is also key within components 
   
- We create a utility that provides us with a common flow and rhythm which in turn, helps us to compose our layouts and components 
   
- Utilities 
   
- A utility, in the context of CUBE CSS, is a CSS class that does one job and does that job well.
