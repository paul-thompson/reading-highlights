- On smaller brochure sites, how you organize your styles isn’t usually a big concern. 
   
- You get in there, write some CSS, or maybe even some SASS. You compile it all into a single stylesheet with SASS’s production settings, and then you aggregate it to get all the stylesheets from modules into a nice tidy package 
   
- how you organize your code is the key to efficiency in at least these three ways: it affects how long it takes you to write code, how much of that code you’ll have to write and how much loading your browser will have to do 
   
- There are plenty of methodologies out there aiming to reduce the CSS footprint, organize cooperation among programmers and maintain large CSS codebases 
   
- SUITCSS
  Structured class names and meaningful hyphens 
   
- Why BEM over the others? 
   
- No matter what methodology you choose to use in your projects, you will benefit from the advantages of more structured CSS and UI. 
   
- The reason I choose BEM over other methodologies comes down to this: it is less confusing than the other methods
