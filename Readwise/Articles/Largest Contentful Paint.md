- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) is an important, user-centric metric for measuring perceived load speed because it marks the point in the page load timeline when the page's main content has likely loadedâ€”a fast LCP helps reassure the user that the page is useful. 
   
- Older metrics like load or DOMContentLoaded are not good because they don't necessarily correspond to what the user sees on their screen. 
   
- First Contentful Paint (FCP) only capture the very beginning of the loading experience 
   
- What is LCP? 
   
- The Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) metric reports the render time of the largest visible within the viewport, relative to when the page first started loading. 
   
- What is a good LCP score 
   
- To provide a good user experience, sites should strive to have Largest Contentful Paint of 2.5 seconds or less 
   
- a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices 
   
- What elements are considered? 
   
- the types of elements considered for Largest Contentful Paint are 
   
- <img> elements
  <image> elements inside an <svg> element
  <video> elements (the poster image is used)
  An element with a background image loaded via the url() function (as opposed to a CSS gradient)
  Block-level elements containing text nodes or other inline-level text elements children. 
   
- How is an element's size determined? 
   
- The size of the element reported for Largest Contentful Paint is typically the size that's visible to the user within the viewport 
   
- If the element extends outside of the viewport, or if any of the element is clipped or has non-visible overflow, those portions do not count toward the element's size. 
   
- For image elements that have been resized from their intrinsic size, the size that gets reported is either the visible size or the intrinsic size, whichever is smaller 
   
- For text elements, only the size of their text nodes is considered (the smallest rectangle that encompasses all text nodes). 
   
- The key point is that every text node belongs to (and only to) its closest block-level ancestor element. In spec terms: each text node belongs to the element that generates its containing block. 
   
- Web pages often load in stages, and as a result, it's possible that the largest element on the page might change. 
   
- It's important to note that an element can only be considered the largest contentful element once it has rendered and is visible to the user. 
   
- Images that have not yet loaded are not considered "rendered". Neither are text nodes using web fonts during the font block period 
   
- If an element that is currently the largest contentful element is removed from the viewport (or even removed from the DOM), it will remain the largest contentful element unless a larger element is rendered. 
   
- When is largest contentful paint reported? 
   
- The browser will stop reporting new entries as soon as the user interacts with the page (via a tap, scroll, or keypress), as user interaction often changes what's visible to the user (which is especially true with scrolling). 
   
- Caution: Since users can open pages in a background tab, it's possible that the largest contentful paint will not happen until the user focuses the tab, which can be much later than when they first loaded it. 
   
- Load time vs. render time 
   
- For security reasons, the render timestamp of images is not exposed for cross-origin images that lack the Timing-Allow-Origin header. 
   
- How are element layout and size changes handled? 
   
- Only the element's initial size and position in the viewport is considered. 
   
- This means images that are initially rendered off-screen and then transition on-screen may not be reported. 
   
- LCP can be measured in the lab or in the field, and it's available in the following tools 
   
- How to measure LCP 
   
- Field tools
  Chrome User Experience Report
  PageSpeed Insights
  Search Console (Core Web Vitals report)
  web-vitals JavaScript library 
   
- Lab tools
  Chrome DevTools
  Lighthouse
  WebPageTest 
   
- measuring LCP in JavaScript is more complicated. 
   
- Measure LCP in JavaScript 
   
- LCP is primarily affected by four factors 
   
- How to improve LCP 
   
- Slow server response times
  Render-blocking JavaScript and CSS
  Resource load times
  Client-side rendering
