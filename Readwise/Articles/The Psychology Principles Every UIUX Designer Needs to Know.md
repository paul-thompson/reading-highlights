- UX Psychology plays a big part in a user’s experience with an application 
   
- Von Restorff effect 
   
- The Von Restorff effect (also known as the isolation effect) predicts that when multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered! 
   
- This is the main reason why all call-to-actions (CTAs) look different from the rest of the action buttons on a site or application! 
   
- Serial position effect 
   
- The Serial Position Effect is the propensity of a user to best remember the first and last items in a series. 
   
- most applications nowadays ditch the hamburger menu and go for a bottom or top bar navigation, placing the most important user actions to the right or left. 
   
- Cognitive load 
   
- Cognitive load refers to the total amount of mental effort being used in a person's working memory. 
   
- "Cognitive load is the amount of thought you need to exercise in order to complete a specific task 
   
- Cognitive load theory can be differentiated into three types: 
   
- Intrinsic cognitive load
  Extraneous cognitive load
  Germane cognitive load 
   
- Intrinsic Cognitive Load 
   
- Intrinsic cognitive load is the difficulty associated with a specific instructional topic. 
   
- Germane Cognitive Load 
   
- Germane cognitive load is the cognitive load devoted to processing information and construction of schema 
   
- One of the reasons we use design patterns is because they're something we're programmed to do by default 
   
- "It’s easier for users to learn something new if they can discern it to a pattern from something they understand" 
   
- Hick’s Law 
   
- Hick’s Law is the most popular principle, along with the Gestalt Laws 
   
- Hick's Law describes that the time it takes for a person to make a decision depends on the choices available to him or her. 
   
- A very nice example of Hick’s Law that applies to user experience design are lists 
   
- Law of Proximity 
   
- Law of proximity is part of the Gestalt Laws of Perceptual Organization, and it states that objects that are near, or proximate to each other, tend to be grouped together 
   
- our brain can easily associate objects close to each other, better than it does objects that are spaced far apart 
   
- there is a need to group things together when designing a UI, as well as the importance of being careful when putting things together since users may naturally think they are associated with each other.
