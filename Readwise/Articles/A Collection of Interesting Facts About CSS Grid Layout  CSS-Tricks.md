- Negative values lower than -1 may be used for grid-row-end and grid-column-end 
   
- you can set grid-column: 1 / -2 to span the cells between the first and the second to last line. 
   
- Itâ€™s possible to use negative values in grid-column/row-start 
   
- Another interesting thing about negative values is that you can use them on grid-column/row-start as well. The difference between positive and negative values is that with negative values the placement will come from the opposite side. 
   
- Generated content pseudo-elements (::before and ::after) are treated as grid items 
   
- Animating CSS Grid Layout properties 
   
- there are 5 animatable grid properties:
  grid-gap, grid-row-gap, grid-column-gap
  grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows 
   
- The value of grid-column/row-end can be lower than the start value 
   
- the value of grid-column-end or grid-row-end may be lower than the respective start equivalent 
   
- Using the `span` keyword on grid-column/row-start and grid-column/row-end 
   
- A grid item by default spans a single cell. If you want to change that, the span keyword can be quite convenient 
   
- span 2 will make the grid item span two cells 
   
- grid-template-areas and implicit named lines 
   
- If you create template areas in a grid, you automatically get four implicit named lines, two naming the row-start and row-end and two for the column-start and column-end
