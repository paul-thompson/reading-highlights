- simplified so as to be intellectually undemanding and accessible to a wide audience. 
   
- You are trying not to exclude people based on their education, cognitive function or reading ability 
   
- If we write clearly with good structure, short sentences and plain language we are helping people read 
   
- What’s more important to your users: learning how to read your information or understanding it? 
   
- I’m not saying don’t use technical terms, just explain them the first time you use them on a page 
   
- Having accessible content is making sure everyone can get to the information they are looking for. 
   
- We’re writing clearly because we respect their time, interest and attention 
   
- people don’t trust language when there’s jargon in it. 
   
- “If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.”
  – Albert Einstein
