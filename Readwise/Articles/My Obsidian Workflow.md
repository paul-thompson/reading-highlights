- Starting over with Instapaper was a spiritual cleanse. I now have a reading inbox. I've never gotten to inbox zero, but it is at least a seemingly manageable task 
   
- Readwise is a reading highlights review tool that grabs things like Kindle highlights, Instapaper highlights, and saved tweets and drops a selection of quotes in your inbox every morning.
