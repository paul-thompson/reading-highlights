- Loosely speaking, the flex items of a flex container are boxes representing its in-flow contents. 
   
- Each in-flow child of a flex container becomes a flex item, and each contiguous sequence of child text runs is wrapped in an anonymous block container flex item 
   
   - Note: specification
   
- Flex[box] is for boxes and not for texts
