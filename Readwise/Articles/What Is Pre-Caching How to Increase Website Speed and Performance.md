- What is Pre-caching 
   
- Pre-caching is a technique used to **proactively** store or cache data in anticipation of future requests 
   
- You can perform pre-caching on the **client-side** such as in the web browser. Alternatively, you can also do it on the **server-side** using Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) or other caching solutions 
   
- How Pre-caching Works 
   
- The process of pre-caching requires you to store a copy of the data in a location that’s closer to the user or store the data in advance so that it is readily available when needed. 
   
- **identify the data or resources** that are accessed most frequently. These resources are good candidates for pre-caching. 
   
- After the identification, you need to **decide on the caching system** to store the pre-cached data. 
   
- This could be a local cache on the user’s device or even a distributed cache spanning multiple servers. The choice will depend on the type of resource 
   
- you need to **pre-populate the cache** with the identified resources. This step can be performed automatically by the system during initialization phase. Alternatively, you can do it on an on-demand basis as the data is accessed by the users. Remember, pre-caching is all about being proactive 
   
- Once the setup is ready, you can let your system do the job. Whenever the system needs to access the pre-cached data, it can retrieve directly from the cache instead of fetching from the slower external source 
   
- How to Decide What to Pre-cache 
   
- The success of pre-caching depends on the **quality of data** that is pre-cached. It is important for you to choose the right data to cache.
