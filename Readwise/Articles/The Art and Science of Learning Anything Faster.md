- “If effectiveness is doing the right things, efficiency is doing things right.” 
   
- This is the meta-skill of meta-learning, or learning how to learn. 
   
- take the smartest first steps and use 80/20 analysis to accelerate your progress. 
   
- Meta-learning allows us to mimic the world’s fastest learners to become world class 
   
- Sometimes it pays to model the outliers, not flatten them into averages. 
   
- The top one percent often succeed in spite of how they train, not because of it. 
   
- Using the DiSSS (deconstruction, selection, sequencing, and stakes) process to drastically shorten the time it took to learn languages. 
   
- Deconstruction: What are the minimal learnable units with which you should start? 
   
- Sequencing: In what order should you learn the blocks? 
   
- Stakes: How do you set up stakes to create real consequences and guarantee you follow the program? 
   
- The secondary principles of CaFE (compression, frequency, encoding). 
   
- Compression: Can you encapsulate the most important 20 percent into an easily graspable one-pager? 
   
- Frequency: How frequently should you practice? What is the minimum effective dose (MED) for volume? 
   
- Encoding: How do you anchor the new material to what you already know for rapid recall? 
   
- Learning from the process: applying the answers to your own experiences
