- First: Just Ship Publish It™. 
   
- It might seem like an obvious point but if you want to blog, blog. Don’t work on the technology that powers your blog. Work on the content of your blog. A blog is content first, technology only incidentally. 
   
- most people are unable to finish their side projects or focus on their side hustles, because they get distracted and sidetracked by tinkering and other things that increase the complexity of the project, instead of working toward the original goal. 
   
- Eschew anything beyond writing the content of a post. No art direction. No social media imagery. No comments. No webmentions. No analytics. If you really want to be ruthless, no embedded rich media (images, video, etc.) only links to rich media 
   
- For me, burnout is caused by doing something I usually love at a time when I don’t love it. 
   
- I like this advice: write for you, not for others. And if you can’t think of what to “write”, document something for yourself and call it writing. 
   
- So write about what you want, not what you think others want, and the words will spill out
