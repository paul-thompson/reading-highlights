- You can't please all of the people all of the time 
   
- content needs to be 
   
- easy to understand
  easy to retain
  easy to act upon 
   
- Tone and style 
   
- being informative, succinct, reassuring, brisk (but not terse) and most importantly focusing on what you can usefully tell people they can do. 
   
- The common case 
   
- take information that affects most of our users and putting it up front. 
   
- If you are an edge case or exception 
   
- your information will still be there - it just won't be in the first paragraph. 
   
- The Journey 
   
- words matter - understanding our audience, using the right terms and trusting our editors means that users get the right information in the most digestible format 
   
- understanding matters - understanding content is more important than covering every eventuality 
   
- iteration matters -we will keep evolving the style guide, presentation and content design as we learn
