- If you could save yourself effort from typing in your login credentials on each site visit, would you do it? Most people would. That’s why the “Remember me” option on logins exists 
   
- Users often forget to tick the checkbox when they log in. As a result, the majority of users aren’t utilizing this convenient feature. This is because they need to exert cognitive effort to remember the “remember me” checkbox. 
   
- Not only that, but non-tech-savvy users don’t understand what “Remember me” exactly means. 
   
- The reason the option exists is to safeguard users who log in from a public or shared computer 
   
- Remember Me by Default and Log Me Out 
   
- Users no longer have to remember to tick the checkbox if a site remembers their info by default. This decision makes sense because most users log into sites from a personal computer. 
   
- Logging in from a public or shared computer is the exception. As such, a checkbox for logging out after the session ends needs to exist. 
   
- you should have a “Log me out after” checkbox. Ticking it would automatically log users out when they exit the browser. 
   
- Since public and shared computer users know when they’re in a sensitive environment, they’re more cautious of security. Because they’re more cognizant, remembering to tick the checkbox doesn’t require as much cognitive effort. 
   
- This auto log out option also saves users the trouble of hunting for the log out button, which can be hard to find.
