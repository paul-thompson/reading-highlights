- In a long sentence, you can use commas to separate out extra information and make the sentence easier to read. 
   
- commas do the same job as brackets but look a lot neater in your writing 
   
- A clause is the building block for a sentence. Commas can be used to break up sentences that have more than one clause and make them easier to read 
   
- Subordinate clauses do not make sense on their own.
  These clauses need the main part of the sentence to make sense, so they are connected with a comma.
