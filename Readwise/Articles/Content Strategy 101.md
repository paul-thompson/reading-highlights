- **Summary:** A content strategy is a high-level plan that guides the intentional creation and maintenance of information in a digital product 
   
- A content strategy ensures that every piece of content in the experience serves and sustains a legitimate purpose. 
   
- A content strategy will usually specify 
   
- **The point of the content** (business objective or user need) 
   
- Who will **own, create, measure, and maintain** the information 
   
- **How** and **where** the content will **best meet users’ needs** (formats, channels, style, tone, word usage, etc.) 
   
- How the content should be **structured**, **tagged**, and **organized** for findability and contextual visibility 
   
- How the content will be **published** and fit **in the overall experience** 
   
- Content Strategy vs. Content Tactics 
   
- A **content strategy comes *before* tactics.** It plans, clarifies, and connects the tactics to a meaningful purpose. 
   
- Phases and Components of Content Strategy 
   
- Content strategy comprises four conceptual phases:
  • **Planning**
  • **Creation**
  • **Maintenance**
  • **Unpublishing** (or removal from the digital product or the user experience) 
   
- Four conceptual phases of content strategy include planning, creation, maintenance, and unpublishing. Content continuously moves through the planning, creation, and maintenance phases, until removed. Use this framework to explain and define your own content strategy
