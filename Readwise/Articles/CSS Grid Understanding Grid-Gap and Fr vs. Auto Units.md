- There is a lot to know in Grid, but Grid isnâ€™t complicated: it just has many, many options for the ways you can write it in order to make your code as clear and flexible as possible 
   
- Grid can generate vertical **columns** and horizontal **rows**. These are bordered and separated by **grid lines** and both columns and rows can be called grid **tracks**. 
   
- Tracks that we write into and define in our layout are called **explicit tracks**, while columns and rows that Grid will generate automatically based on our content are called **implicit tracks**. 
   
- The intersection of a row and column creates a **grid cell**. 
   
- What does `display: grid` affect? 
   
- Like Flexbox, Grid begins with a parent container that affects child elements one level deep
