- Law of Similarity 
   
- Overview 
   
- The human eye tends to perceive similar elements in a design as a complete picture, shape, or group, even if those elements are separated 
   
- Takeaways 
   
- Elements that are visually similar will be perceived as related. 
   
- Color, shape, and size, orientation and movement can signal that elements belong to the same group and likely share a common meaning or functionality. 
   
- Ensure that links and navigation systems are visually differentiated from normal text elements. 
   
- Origins 
   
- The principles of grouping (or Gestalt laws of grouping) are a set of principles in psychology, first proposed by Gestalt psychologists to account for the observation that humans naturally perceive objects as organized patterns and objects 
   
- These principles are organized into five categories: Proximity, Similarity, Continuity, Closure, and Connectedness.
