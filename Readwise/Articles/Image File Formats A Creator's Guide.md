- Lossy vs. lossless compression 
   
- Lossy compression means the image is compressed in a way that reduces visual quality 
   
- Lossless compression can reduce file size, but preserves visual quality 
   
- How to choose the right image file format 
   
- JPG (or JPEG): Joint Photographic Experts Group 
   
- JPG file format is best for photographs and artwork. 
   
- They are smaller file sizes than PNGs and will load quicker and provide a better user experience. 
   
- Don't use a JPG for graphics, logos or anything with fine detail and an extensive color palette. JPGs also don’t have a transparency channel. 
   
- PNG: Portable Network Graphic 
   
- PNGs are typically used for graphics, including infographics, logos, illustrations, diagrams and app screenshots. 
   
- With PNGs, your image can contain an “alpha channel” (transparency) that will composite over its background. PNGs are very efficient for small images. 
   
- GIFs: Graphics Interchange Format 
   
- GIF, being such an old image format (last released in 1989), tends to be inefficient and file sizes can be quite large relative to video, which is much more efficient. 
   
- Video (often .mp4 format) is a better choice for animations, giving users more control over playback and more efficient use of bandwidth. 
   
- WebP: A modern image format 
   
- WebP is a file format developed by Google back in 2010. WebP provides both lossless and lossy compression for images 
   
- WebP's feature set includes lossless compression and an alpha channel (partial transparency), but with a much smaller file size than PNG. 
   
- SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics 
   
- SVG is a graphics format that is infinitely scalable (the “vector” part — describing lines with math instead of pixels), efficient, can be animated, has accessibility affordances and can be made interactive. 
   
- icons, logos and illustrations are highly efficient with SVG. 
   
- Best image formats for common use cases 
   
- PNG for photographs can have a place when you are doing photo editing or need lossless edits — but those are for editing workflows, not web delivery 
   
- Screenshots and type 
   
- If screenshots are of clean shapes without noise or a lot of gradients, WebP is the best choice, and PNG will also preserve the fine details of typography and user interface elements.
