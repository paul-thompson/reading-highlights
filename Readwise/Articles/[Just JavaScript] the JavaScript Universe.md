- In my JavaScript universe, values float in space. 
   
- All primitive values have something in common. There’s nothing I can do in my code that would affect them. 
   
- Objects and Functions are also values, but they are not primitive. This makes them very special. 
   
- Objects and functions are special because I can manipulate them from my code. 
   
- I can say that if primitive values are like distant stars, then objects and functions are more like rocks floating nearby my code. They’re close enough that I can manipulate them.
  And that’s the second kind of values. 
   
- Expressions 
   
- there are some questions that JavaScript would be delighted to answer. These questions have a special name — they are called expressions. 
   
- Expressions are questions that JavaScript can answer. JavaScript answers expressions in the only way it knows how — with values. 
   
- If the word “expression” confuses you, think of it as a piece of code that expresses a value 
   
- We ask JavaScript 2 + 2, and it answers with 4 
   
- Expressions always result in a single value 
   
- At first, all values in the JavaScript cosmos might look the same — bright dots in the sky. But if you look closely, you’ll realize there are fewer than ten different types of values 
   
- Types of Values 
   
- As an aspiring astronomer, you might want to know about every type of value that can be observed in the JavaScript sky. 
   
- Undefined (undefined), used for unintentionally missing values. 
   
- Undefined 
   
- used for unintentionally missing values. 
   
- Null (null), used for intentionally missing values. 
   
- Null 
   
- used for intentionally missing values. 
   
- Booleans 
   
- used for logical operations. 
   
- Symbols 
   
- used to hide implementation details. 
   
- BigInts 
   
- used for math on big numbers. 
   
- Objects and Functions 
   
- Objects 
   
- used to group related data and code. 
   
- Functions 
   
- used to refer to code. 
   
- The rest are all objects! For example, even arrays, dates, and regular expressions fundamentally are objects in JavaScript 
   
- “this is because everything is an object!” Alas, this is a popular urban legend, but it’s not true. 
   
- JavaScript creates a wrapper object when you do this, and then immediately discards it 
   
- you only need to remember that primitive values, such as numbers and strings, are not objects 
   
- We can think of values as different things “floating” in our JavaScript universe. They don’t exist inside our code, but we can refer to them from our code. 
   
- There are two categories of values: there are Primitive Values, and then there are Objects and Functions 
   
- We can ask questions with expressions
