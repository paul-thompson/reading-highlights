- Resizing an image is typically 4x-5x faster than using the quickest ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick settings due to its use of libvips 
   
- As well as image resizing, operations such as rotation, extraction, compositing and gamma correction are available. 
   
- Most modern macOS, Windows and Linux systems running Node.js >= 12.13.0 do not require any additional install or runtime dependencies.
