- we need to determine how to arrange these boxes on the screen. This is the role of the CSS visual formatting model. 
   
- In order to define a rendering model that fits well with the existing structure of HTML, CSS splits boxes into several types with different properties 
   
- There are two primary types of boxes described by the visual formatting model:
  inline box
  block box. 
   
- The two types of boxes correspond pretty much with the element types in HTML 4. By default, inline boxes are generated by inline elements, and block boxes are generated by block boxes. 
   
- CSS provides the ability to change the type of box generated by an element. You do this with the display property 
   
- CSS boxes are generated for content without a corresponding element. These are called “anonymous boxes”
