- When I think about the products I love, they all have one thing in common: delightful little details. 
   
- In design, one detail that often gets overlooked is microcopy — the little bits of text that guide us through an experience 
   
- In apps and websites, microcopy includes things like button labels, hint text, and error messages. 
   
- Show that you’re human 
   
- good microcopy can show that real people created your product. If your product sounds human, it’s easier for people to trust you 
   
- Sprinkle in some surprise 
   
- “The secret to delightful microcopy is surprise.”
  — Some dude on Medium 
   
- Think of safe places in your product where you can surprise people with a little delight:
  A loading screen
  A success message
  An error message
  An example or placeholder
  An onboarding flow
  An empty state 
   
- Boost their confidence 
   
- In a multi-step flow, microcopy can encourage people to keep going. People are lazy. Sometimes, we all need a little motivation to get things done. 
   
- Get a little personal 
   
- By customizing the message for a specific person or group of people, you can make them feel special. 
   
- Sweat the details 
   
- If you look at any web or mobile product, you’d be surprised how much microcopy there is. 
   
- All this talk of delightful microcopy might sound fine and dandy, but honestly, it’s a hard thing to get right. 
   
- keep in mind the dangers of delightful design, because too much whimsy can get in the way. 
   
- In interface writing, it’s usually best to strive for brevity and clarity. But fun microcopy often requires longer messages and less clarity. 
   
- Find your voice 
   
- Many companies have a writing style guide that defines their voice and tone. 
   
- Don’t use clever copy in common flows 
   
- If someone has to read your clever copy every time they launch your app, it’ll get annoying really fast 
   
- Take risks while you can. If you’re a smaller brand, it’s a lot easier to experiment with fun microcopy 
   
- Consider randomized messages. Sometimes you can make an experience more delightful by showing a different message each time
