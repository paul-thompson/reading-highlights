- “A product should be usable enough to handle the user’s erroneous actions gracefully.” 
   
- Be Clear And Not Ambiguous 
   
- Write error messages in clear and simple language. The user should be able to understand the problem while reading an error message. 
   
- Be Short And Meaningful 
   
- The error message should contain the necessary information. Most of the time user is not willing to read a long story 
   
- Avoid using redundant words and do not over-communicate the problem 
   
- Don’t Use Technical Jargons 
   
- If a message contains technical terms or jargons, the user gets confused. 
   
- Try to use simple and plain language without referring to implementation details 
   
- Be Humble — Don’t Blame User 
   
- A good error message is humble. It conveys the issues gracefully to its user without blaming him for his actions 
   
- “A good way to incorporate more human tone to your error messages is to think about explaining it out loud to someone. How does it sound when you speak it in conversation.” — Sonia Gregory 
   
- Avoid Negative Words 
   
- Give Direction to User 
   
- A good error message has three parts: problem identification, cause details if helpful, and a solution if possible. 
   
- Be Specific And Relevant 
   
- Point out the exact location of the problem — where the user should go and what steps are needed to follow to resolve it 
   
- Avoid Uppercase Text 
   
- Upper case text is difficult to read it gives an impact of shouting on the user. 
   
- Provide Appropriate Actions 
   
- “Give alert buttons succinct, logical titles. The best button titles consist of one or two words that describe the result of selecting the button.” — iOS guidelines 
   
- Use Progressive Disclosure Approach 
   
- Just make sure to place the least needed information in these sections as most of the time users will not go to the Show/Hide section 
   
- Use Proper Placement 
   
- when the user is filling the information in a form, it is the best experience to provide validation error along with the controls it relates to. 
   
- An error message should be visible and noticeable. A message appearing on a screen should display in the current view even user has scrolled the view to the top or bottom 
   
- Conclusion 
   
- “The best error message is the one that never shows up” — Thomas Fuchs
