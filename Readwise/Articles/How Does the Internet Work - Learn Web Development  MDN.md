- The Internet is the backbone of the Web, the technical infrastructure that makes the Web possible 
   
- each computer on a network is connected to a special tiny computer called a router. 
   
- This router has only one job: like a signaler at a railway station, it makes sure that a message sent from a given computer arrives at the right destination computer. 
   
- By connecting computers to routers, then routers to routers, we are able to scale infinitely. 
   
- An ISP is a company that manages some special routers that are all linked together and can also access other ISPs' routers. So the message from our network is carried through the network of ISP networks to the destination network 
   
- If you want to send a message to a computer, you have to specify which one. Thus any computer linked to a network has a unique address that identifies it, called an "IP address" (where IP stands for Internet Protocol). 
   
- To make things easier, we can alias an IP address with a human readable name called a domain name. For example (at the time of writing; IP addresses can change) google.com is the domain name used on top of the IP address 173.194.121.32. 
   
- the Internet is a technical infrastructure which allows billions of computers to be connected all together.
