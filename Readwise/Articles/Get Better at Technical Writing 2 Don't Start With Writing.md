- Technical Writing is not just about writing. There are a whole lot to consider and do before writing even the first draft. 
   
- A huge amount of the writing process should involve research/learning, testing the product or a language's use case, before any writing should be done. 
   
- it is healthy to say that 80% of the writing process should be spent not writing, but researching and testing 
   
- If you do not work with a team, you are most likely a developer/engineer who found the beauty of Community as a Service (CaaS). 
   
- You learn something new and want to teach it to the community through writing. If this screams you, then your writing process involves most of these steps, but a lot more coding. 
   
- Define Your Audience 
   
- This is an important first step in pushing out a content. Who are you writing for? 
   
- The foremost duty every technical writer has is to create content that their intended audiences will read and find useful. Any other duty is inferior to this. 
   
- Do Your Own Research 
   
- A common thing I noticed among the expert technical writers I know is that they create honest work. Producing unique, honest, and unplagiarized content means you know enough to write in your own words 
   
- Research sparks up more curiosity in the technical writer. Some newbies in technical writing often ask questions like: how to find new topics to write about, how to write unique content for a topic already written on before. A great way to do either of these is to embrace research 
   
- Test Before Publishing 
   
- Writing an article or manual for a product, a software, or a programming language means you are familiar with it through and through 
   
- In another sense, testing means making sure your content is unfalsifiable. Put testing at the back of your mind and you're sure to produce great content that your readers can find useful. 
   
- This is the case for CaaS writers. Before clicking the Publish button, make sure you have tested every piece of code you included in your write-up, in as much widely used platforms as possible for you. 
   
- For you, the technical writer, your software are docs and articles, and you have to test thoroughly before taking them to production. 
   
- Benefits of Researching and Testing 
   
- You push out content that is absolutely useful to your reader - your ultimate goal for writing in the first place. 
   
- It is not just useful, it is also easy to implement/reproduce by your readers. In other words, it works on other people's machine too.
