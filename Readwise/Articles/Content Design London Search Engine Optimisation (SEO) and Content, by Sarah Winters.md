- SEO is no longer A Thing 
   
- I think we should stop thinking of it as Search Engine Optimised and more that it is human optimised content. 
   
- A couple of things we know search likes 
   
- Google is looking for unique content, something it won’t find anywhere else. 
   
- Content-relevant words
  Humans use words to find things, those words need to be on the page 
   
- Links 
   
- Google thinks if lots of places link to you then people like your content 
   
- Domain trust 
   
- If you can get links from trusted domains, you are also doing well. If you are not a trusted domain you need to become one 
   
- Accessibility 
   
- If you are not accessible, you are going to move down the rankings. Simple as that 
   
- Get my audience vocabulary 
   
- At the very least I go to www.google.co.uk/trends/explore or use Google Adwords, and get those words 
   
- use techniques like looking in forums and social media to find vocabulary. The best way to get audience vocabulary and mental models is proper user research 
   
- Structure content based on mental models 
   
- This is how your audience expects you to have that content. Is it chronological? Is it as a process? 
   
- Notes 
   
- Putting keywords in the headings adds more weight to that term for the page (apparently) and it can – with a bunch of other factors involved – help get you a higher search result 
   
- I think content people shouldn’t put one word on a page or a tweet or a blog post until they know their audience’s language and mental models
