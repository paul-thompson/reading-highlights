- Smartphones, pings and Insta-everything have shortened our attention span 
   
- Our attention spans while on our computers and smartphones have become short — crazily short — as we now spend about 47 seconds on any screen on average,” Dr. Mark wrote in her new book, “Attention Span: A Groundbreaking Way to Restore Balance, Happiness and Productivity.” 
   
- First, understand what’s distracting you. 
   
- our brains are evolutionarily designed to pay attention to novelty, these alerts are almost impossible to ignore. And if you try to, you’ll likely find your anxiety mounting. 
   
- Turning off notifications is a good way to reduce distractions — indeed, it’s a classic tip — but it won’t completely solve the problem 
   
- Dr. Mark observed that when the number of external interruptions waned, the number of self-interruptions rose. 
   
- “We get into this pattern of having short attention spans,” she said. “And if we’re not being interrupted by something external to us, then we switch gears and begin to interrupt ourselves.” 
   
- Research shows that heavier smartphone use is correlated with higher levels of [cortisol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6143708/) and other [markers of stress](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563217306908). [Rising anxiety](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563214002805) could become an internal signal to look at your texts or Twitter, even without a chime or vibration 
   
- our brains aren’t capable of focusing for long periods of time. Sustaining attention and resisting distractions uses up cognitive resources, and we need to replenish them periodically to regain focus 
   
- Take a timed tech break 
   
- Neither Dr. Mark nor Dr. Rosen are fans of trying to go cold turkey by declaring a phone-free day or using software to block certain websites. People inevitably return to their old habits when they have access again, and they don’t improve their self control. 
   
- Try deep reading (on paper). 
   
- screens are designed to make us read very quickly — to scan, skim and scroll. As a result, we don’t give the text our full attention and are more apt to miss information. 
   
- Traditionally, our brains tended to [read print materials](https://dra.american.edu/islandora/object/auislandora%3A94839) more slowly, in part because we were more likely to go back and double-check what we just read. That extra time lent itself to sophisticated mental processes like critical analysis, inference, deduction and empathy. 
   
- Our brains adapt to read in the style of the medium we use most often, and chances are you spend a lot more time reading on a screen than you do on paper. As a result, Dr. Wolf said, you likely now read in print the way you read on a screen 
   
- To get back in the practice of what Dr. Wolf calls “deep reading,” try to dedicate at least 20 minutes a day to reading a physical book, combined with Dr. Mark and Dr. Rosen’s tips to fight distraction.
