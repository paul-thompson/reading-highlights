- Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have been the bread and butter of user interface design since the mid 1980s. 
   
- They make the affordances visible, 
   
- Before GUIs, every computer interface was a command-line interface (CLI). You typed memorised text-based commands into an input 
   
- Well-designed GUIs make interfaces easier for new users to learn, improve discoverability, and are better suited to multi-tasking workflows 
   
- simply finding what's available in this dizzying UI becomes a challenge 
   
- We usually rely on a mix of spatial memory and well-written labels to find what we need in this kind of interface 
   
- Command bars are command-line bars that pop up in the middle of the screen when you hit a keyboard shortcut 
   
- Traditionally ⌘ + K, hence the moniker “Command K bars.” 
   
- If you're in the middle of writing something, you don't even have to take your hands off the keyboard. A few quick finger strokes and you can find the action you need and run it. 
   
- These bars also do double duty as universal search bars. You're not only searching through the available actions in an app. You can also search through content like documents, file names, and tasks. 
   
- By stashing infrequently-used items in a command bar like this, you can clear up a lot of screen real estate 
   
- Keeping the interface clear of options helps reduce the number of things users need to pay attention to at any one time. Which means they're less likely to be overwhelmed and confused by irrelevant features. 
   
- These pre-built bars stuff an enormous amount of sophisticated UI functionality into their little rectangles. They can give you tabs, filters on searches, recommended actions, inline forms, pop-up menus, grid displays, dark mode, and more.
