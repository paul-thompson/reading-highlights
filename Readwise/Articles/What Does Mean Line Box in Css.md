- The rectangular area that contains the boxes that form a line is called a line box. 
   
- When several inline-level boxes cannot fit horizontally within a single line box, they are distributed among two or more vertically-stacked line boxes. 
   
- paragraph is a vertical stack of line boxes. 
   
- When an inline box exceeds the width of a line box, it is split into several boxes and these boxes are distributed across several line boxes 
   
- if the inline box contains a single character, or language specific word breaking rules disallow a break within the inline box, or if the inline box is affected by a white-space value of nowrap or pre), then the inline box overflows the line box.
