- Microcopy is the small, informative, or instructional text on forms, fields, labels, pop-ups, buttons, search prompts, etc 
   
- In order to design effective microcopy, we need to take into consideration the way users process information and read text 
   
- According to NN/g 
   
- Scanning text is typical behaviour for higher-literacy users. 
   
- Users read only about 20% of the text on an average page with 600 to 800 words. 
   
- Concise text, objective language, and scannable copy improve usability by 124%. 
   
- Effective UX microcopy is 
   
- clear, concise, and easy to understand 
   
- It takes on the voice and tone of the brand 
   
- It fits in visually and feels like a part of the design 
   
- It fills a need, answers a question, or builds empathy (depending on the product) 
   
- It motivates users to take an action 
   
- It anticipates and addresses user issues 
   
- Use action verbs 
   
- Action verbs should be used instead of generic words 
   
- Passive labels not only make it riskier to take action, but it forces users to do more work. 
   
- Action verb button labels are more task-efficient and prevent user errors. 
   
- Use task-specific language 
   
- Button copy should match the action. The buttons we use should always clearly describe what action the user takes when they click them. 
   
- Avoid making them uncertain by using a button label that describes the result of the user’s task 
   
- To improve the UX, the form button should describe exactly what the user is doing in their task. 
   
- Consistency 
   
- When writing copy for buttons, it is important to keep consistency 
   
- Choose amount of words: How many words on average should different components have? 
   
- Choose case: Capitalization should be consistently used throughout the product. 
   
- Label structure: You need to decide on a structure for labels 
   
- Are they including only a verb or a combination of verbs and nouns (e.g. ‘verb’ + ‘noun’, or ‘verb’, or ‘verb’ + a + ‘noun’)? 
   
- Use microcopy for transparency 
   
- Effective microcopy can inform the user why the information is being asked and how it will be used. 
   
- Avoid Jargon 
   
- Small, straightforward words speak louder than big, important-sounding words, but jargon still manages to sneak into our interfaces. 
   
- Pay attention to capitalization 
   
- Capitalization is a tool in UX writing to improve comprehension and consistency of text elements and it needs to be given due importance. 
   
- Know your user 
   
- Good microcopy is supposed to inform and assist the users while they are using your product.
