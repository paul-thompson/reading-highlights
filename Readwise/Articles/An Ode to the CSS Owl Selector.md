- Solving solutions in CSS can be easy or elegant 
   
- It has the beautiful name of 'adjacent sibling combinator'. It applies the defined styles to the second element if immediately follows the first element 
   
- The * + * seems to be an elegant solution when using margin-top. The margin-top is only applied between the elements. But you can also have images using img or svg elements which have different spacing. 
   
- it works on nested elements! 
   
- The owl selector is a wonderful example showing how complex parsing CSS selectors can be. It shows the real power of CSS. Why? Because it works nested.
