- Summary 
   
- There are 3 main time limits (which are determined by human perceptual abilities) to keep in mind when optimizing web and application performance 
   
- 0.1 second 
   
- user feel that the system is reacting instantaneously, meaning that no special feedback is necessary except to display the result. 
   
- 1.0 second 
   
- limit for the user's flow of thought to stay uninterrupted, even though the user will notice the delay. 
   
- 10 seconds is about the limit for keeping the user's attention focused on the dialogue 
   
- Feedback during the delay is especially important if the response time is likely to be highly variable, since users will then not know what to expect. 
   
- The fact that computers can be too fast indicates the need for user-interface changes, like animations, to be timed according to a real-time clock rather than being timed as an indirect effect of the computer's execution speed 
   
- Progress indicators have three main advantages: They reassure the user that the system has not crashed but is working on his or her problem; they indicate approximately how long the user can be expected to wait, thus allowing the user to do other activities during long waits; and they finally provide something for the user to look at 
   
- Most web browsers fail in providing useful progress bars, since they don't communicate what percentage of the entire download for a page has been completed.
