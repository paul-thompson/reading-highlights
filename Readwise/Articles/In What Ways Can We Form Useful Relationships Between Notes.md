- Maps of Contents (MOCs) are game-changers 
   
- A flat structure of notes — i.e. one big folder — is “frictionless”. 
   
- However, over time it becomes messy and overwhelming. To overcome the chaos, we need to build healthy, flexible frameworks that can grow with our knowledge over time. 
   
- Direct Links 
   
- Direct links are the strongest type of relationship. They are the purest and most explicit way of connecting two notes. 
   
- Despite the proclamations, direct links alone are not enough. They do not allow for easy, dependable high-level navigation 
   
- They are a system of streets connecting one block to another. But sometimes you want to zoom out and view the map 
   
- Folders 
   
- Folders are rigid and exclusionary by their nature. 
   
- Without special workarounds this limits note accessibility, discourages interdisciplinary thinking, and stunts the long-term growth of a complex and interesting zettelkasten. 
   
- If you have some quixotic notion about creating a digital library that acts as an interesting conversation partner — folders don’t make it as easy. 
   
- A possible use for a folder is as a temporary inbox, or “incubation” folder 
   
- Another possible use for folders would be for “very clearly defined” notes. 
   
- You won’t have a zettelkasten, you’ll have a collection of silo-ed folders. Those are massive costs to consider. 
   
- Tags 
   
- Tags are relatively weak associations, but don’t discount them 
   
- Whenever you take notes on something you read or watch, you apply that tag. It’s great when only 50 notes have that tag. It’s far less useful when 500 notes have that tag. 
   
- Multiple Tags 
   
- A partial solution is to use multiple tags 
   
- Tags with Saved Boolean Search 
   
- Saved Searches are another partial and robust solution. You can save a tag search 
   
- Proximity 
   
- There are 3 basic levels of proximity. 
   
- Organizing by Proximity in the main folder 
   
- Alphabetical 
   
- relationships that start out strong can weaken over time. 
   
- Chronological 
   
- they are inherently more arbitrary (random), except for their temporal context (which holds varying value depending on the context). 
   
- Organizing by Proximity in the same subfolder 
   
- Notes in the same subfolder will have a closer relationship since they are grouped in the same vicinity 
   
- Organizing by Proximity in an MOC (Map of Content) 
   
- Notes in the same MOC are very likely to be closely related, especially after they are manually sorted in some form of relational positioning. This is the best way to apply the power of proximity. 
   
- Higher-Order Notes 
   
- Map of Contents (MOC) 
   
- An MOC is just a note — a very special type of note. It uses proximity effectively and acts like a tag and a non-exclusive folder at the same time. 
   
- Tag-like: It groups the links of associated notes in a non-exclusive way. 
   
- Folder-like: It assembles notes in a tightly-packed grouping. 
   
- Proximity: It grants you the ability to deliberately position each note in relation to the other notes. 
   
- MOCs don’t limit access, they curate it — while keeping your notes free. 
   
- MOCs are Evergreen notes, just at the next level of emergence. 
   
- MOCs are fluid, TOCs are rigid. This is by design 
   
- MOCs serve much broader purposes. Oftentimes an MOC can morph into a TOC as a project starts to finalize 
   
- A Home Note 
   
- Think of your Home note as the highest-level of your zettelkasten / digital library 
   
- It is an excellent access point because it encourages you to focus on the areas in your life that you’ve deemed as important.
