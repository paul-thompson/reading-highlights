- The common view 
   
- The consensus among typographers is that we should avoid long line lengths when designing 
   
- The research which supports these recommendations has reported that long line lengths decrease reading speed and increase the number of (right-to-left saccades). 
   
- The explanation 
   
- The problem with return sweeps is that they can be inaccurate: undershooting (failing to reach the beginning of the next line) or locating the . 
   
- undershooting as an under-sweep 
   
- The assumptions 
   
- We have assumed that the inaccuracy of return sweeps and the need for corrective saccades are undesirable errors and so long line lengths should not be used. 
   
- Their research challenges the view that inaccurate return sweeps are necessarily problematic.
