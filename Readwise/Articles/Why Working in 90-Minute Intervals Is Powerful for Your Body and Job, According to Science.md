- The Ultradian rhythm 
   
- you have biological cycles that are shorter than 24 hours, too. These are ultradian rhythms. 
   
- Utradian rhythms have been made famous primarily through sleep study 
   
- The "father of sleep", sleep researcher Nathaniel Kleitman, figured out that people go through ultradian cycles whenever they get some shuteye 
   
- It was Kleitman who discovered rapid eye movement (REM) and proposed that sleep included active brain processes. 
   
- Kleitman also discovered that a Basic Rest Activity Cycle (BRAC) is present when people are awake, too. 
   
- daily ultradian cycles involve alternating periods of high-frequency brain activity (about 90 minutes) followed by lower-frequency brain activity (about 20 minutes) 
   
- When you work really hard, are alert and your brain is functioning in high brain wave states, you eventually disrupt the sodium/potassium balance. The brain detects this and downshifts, moving toward lower brain wave frequencies for a break 
   
- The result of ignoring your natural cycles 
   
- if you try to push through the rest phase of your ultradian rhythm? You trigger your body's fight-or-flight (stress) response 
   
- How to tune in 
   
- There are specific productivity and cognitive benefits based on how long you sleep, but 10 to 20 minutes (about the length of the lull in your ultradian rhythm) is ideal for alertness
