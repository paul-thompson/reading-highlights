- **mental stimulation begets mental stimulation**. The more we stimulate our mind—including through digital distraction—the more stimulation our mind then craves. Stimulating our mind releases dopamine, a neurotransmitter we crave once we get a hit of it. 
   
- we may feel productive when we distract and stimulate our mind, this stimulation is often a form of mental busyness: we move more things around than we do forward. We become less focused, productive, and calm—while also unwittingly leading ourselves to greater heights of anxiety. 
   
- Stimulation begets stimulation, dopamine begets dopamine, and anxiety begets anxiety. 
   
- calm mornings lead to deliberate days.
