- many people first learned about variables as “boxes” into which you can put stuff. Even if you don’t vividly imagine boxes anymore when you see a variable, they might still behave “boxy” in your imagination 
   
- These intuitions (like “boxiness” of variables) influence how we read code our whole lives. But sometimes, our mental models are wrong 
   
- A good mental model will help you find and fix bugs faster, understand other people’s code better, and feel confident in the code you write 
   
- Because using the “slow” system is so mentally draining, we tend to default to the “fast” one — even when dealing with intellectual tasks like coding 
   
- In the “fast” mode, we guess what the code does based on naming, comments, and its overall structure. In the “slow” mode, we retrace what the code does step by step.
