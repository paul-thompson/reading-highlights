- set yourself up in a quiet room and flick on an NSDR video. It sort of feels like a meditation for sleep, but it’s decidedly not designed to help you doze off. Instead, it promises to put your mind into a deeply restorative, but still alert, state for a short period of time. 
   
- What is non-sleep deep rest? 
   
- Non-sleep deep rest is an umbrella term for practices that people use to direct their minds into a state of calm and focus, says [Dr. Andrew Huberman](https://hubermanlab.com/about/), the Stanford University neuroscience professor who coined the term “non-sleep deep rest.” 
   
- The idea behind NSDR is that getting yourself to a sleep-like state for a short period of time lets the brain rest intensely. This can help you feel restored to take on the rest of your day 
   
- Huberman notes in [a recent lecture](https://hubermanlab.com/teach-and-learn-better-with-a-neuroplasticity-super-protocol/#:~:text=It%20relates%20to%20a-,talk,-I%20recently%20gave) that 20-minute NSDR sessions can help the brain learn more quickly and increase how long you retain information, due to the practice’s effect on [neuroplasticity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3250382/). Interestingly, Winter says that NSDR may also help you get better sleep come bedtime 
   
- How non-sleep deep rest helps with sleep 
   
- “Sleep isn’t always under our control, but rest is. I can tell anyone to close their eyes and rest for 10 minutes. How well you do that depends on your mental state, but you’re still resting,” Winter explains. “It’s a really great gateway to healthy sleep, and a way to come at insomnia from a different angle.” 
   
- Yoga nidra is a chilled-out version of yoga that, rather than moving from pose to pose, gets yogis to lie down and listen to structured meditation that guides them through the five layers of self. Each layer fades as you move from one to the next, leaving you in a state of deep rest.
