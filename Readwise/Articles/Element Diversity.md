- Did you know that there are 112 elements in HTML?! 
   
- Poor knowledge of HTML elements 
   
- don't put enough emphasis on teaching semantic HTML. They teach syntax, basic structure and the ~20 most important elements and attributes, and that's pretty much it. 
   
- See the Pen HTML Tags Memory Test by Paul (@plfstr) on CodePen. 
   
- Lack of understanding why 
   
- Of course, for accessibility, but most people don't know why you need a sound document outline or landmarks, or what the advantages of a button button over a div button are. 
   
- JS frameworks 
   
- . React supports fragments, wrapper elements that don't add extra nodes to the DOM, and Vue supports multi-root components in version 3. 
   
- Insufficient CSS skills 
   
- Even if I miss something, it's much better to add some divs later than wrapping everything preemptively 
   
- Default styles 
   
- divs are so much easier to style than buttons. 
   
- button {
  all: initial;
  } 
   
- button {
  all: initial;
  font: inherit;
  color: inherit;
  } 
   
- We don't care enough about the page 
   
- Many devs don't build pages anymore, they build components. 
   
- The problem with working on small pieces is that it's easy to ignore the big picture 
   
- We can conceive, design, and develop components, but the end results for users is usually a whole page. 
   
- Some elements are hard to style 
   
- To make our designers or customers happy, we don't use the default select element, but we write a complex component that consists of a bunch of divs with aria roles and a lot of JS. 
   
- So?! What's the point of this post? 
   
- Learning how to write HTML is not as hard as learning to write JavaScript, but learning how to write it in a way that it best possibly benefits users also takes time.
