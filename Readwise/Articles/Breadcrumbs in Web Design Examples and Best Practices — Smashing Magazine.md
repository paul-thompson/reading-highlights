- On websites that have a lot of pages, breadcrumb navigation can greatly enhance the way users find their way around 
   
- reduce the number of actions a website visitor needs to take in order to get to a higher-level page, and they improve the findability of website sections and pages 
   
- an effective visual aid that indicates the location of the user within the website’s hierarchy, making it a great source of contextual information for landing pages 
   
- A “breadcrumb” (or “breadcrumb trail”) is a type of secondary navigation scheme that reveals the user’s location in a website or Web application 
   
- You also see them in Web applications that have more than one step, where they function similar to a progress bar. 
   
- In their simplest form, breadcrumbs are horizontally arranged text links separated by the “greater than” symbol (>); 
   
- Use breadcrumb navigation for large websites and websites that have hierarchically arranged pages 
   
- You shouldn’t use breadcrumbs for single-level websites that have no logical hierarchy or grouping 
   
- benefit from breadcrumb navigation is to construct a site map or a diagram representing the website’s navigation architecture, and then analyze whether breadcrumbs would improve the user’s ability to navigate within and between categories. 
   
- Breadcrumb navigation should be regarded as an extra feature and shouldn’t replace effective primary navigation menus 
   
- Location-based Location-based breadcrumbs show the user where they are in the website’s hierarchy 
   
- Attribute-based Attribute-based breadcrumb trails display the attributes of a particular page 
   
- Path-based Path-based breadcrumb trails show users the steps they’ve taken to arrive at a particular page. Path-based breadcrumbs are dynamic in that they display the pages the user has visited before arriving on the current page. 
   
- By offering a breadcrumb trail for all pages on a large multi-level website, users can navigate to higher-level categories more easily. 
   
- Reduces clicks or actions to return to higher-level pages 
   
- Doesn’t usually hog screen space 
   
- The benefit is that they have little to no negative impact in terms of content overload, and they outweigh any negatives if used properly. 
   
- Breadcrumb trails can be a great way to entice first-time visitors to peruse a website after having viewed the landing page 
   
- common mistake in implementing breadcrumbs is using them when there is no benefit. 
   
- Breadcrumb trails have a linear structure, so using them will be difficult if your pages can’t be classified into neat categories 
   
- When a lower-level page is (or can be put) in more than one parent category, breadcrumb trails are ineffective, inaccurate and confusing to the user. 
   
- Typically, the > sign is used to denote hierarchy, as in the format of Parent category > Child category. 
   
- You don’t want your breadcrumbs to dominate the page. A breadcrumb trail functions merely as an aid to users (a convenience); 
   
- your breadcrumb trail is that it shouldn’t be the first item that grabs the user’s attention when arriving on a page.
