- 1. Distance yourself from social media. 
   
- Cull the Twitters, Instagrams, Facebooks of your social media life by ruthlessly discarding any site that doesn’t inherently contribute to a quality life. 
   
- 2. Give yourself a strict period of time to spend working. This limits burnout, work creep, and keeps you focused and urgent on your work. 
   
- The more you give yourself limits, the less time you have for wool gathering as you dither between a newsletter, your Facebook feed 
   
- 3. Use commutes, exercise, cleaning or other repetitive tasks to work out concepts. 
   
- think of it as picking at a tangle of hair instead of saving it for when you have time. 
   
- 4. Prioritize with the 4DX Framework 
   
- The 4DX framework was developed by business consultants and discussed in *The 4 Disciplines of Execution* 
   
- Newport adapted 4DX to support deep work 
   
- Focus on the wildly important 
   
- important 
   
- Act on lead measures 
   
- Two metrics are used: lag measures and lead measures. For deep work, the lead measure “is time spent in a state of deep work dedicated toward your wildly important goal. 
   
- Lag measures describe your output, such as the number of screenplays you completed, songs you composed, or recipes you developed. 
   
- Keep a compelling scoreboard 
   
- a visible tracking system to keep yourself honest about how much time you’re spending on your priority project. It can be as simple as a sticky note on your laptop. 
   
- Create a cadence of accountability 
   
- To keep yourself moving toward your goals, you have to review your progress regularly 
   
- 5. Notice Your Shallow Work to Better Avoid It 
   
- Checking email, filling in a spreadsheet, responding to a general request in Slack, tweaking the monthly slide update — these are all examples of shallow work 
   
- t’s “noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate 
   
- tasks that feel SO NICE to get out of the way, but at the end of the day, mean little
