- To me, the deep life is about focusing with energetic intention on things that really matter — in work, at home, and in your soul — and not wasting too much attention on things that don’t 
   
- The tricky part in cultivating a deep life, of course, is figuring out what things matter 
   
- • **community** (family, friends, etc.),
  • **craft** (work and quality leisure),
  • **constitution** (health), and
  • **contemplation** (matters of the soul) 
   
- You’re only granted so much energy to expend in a lifetime. You’re almost certainly best off focusing it as intensely as you can on the targets that seem to really move the needle.
