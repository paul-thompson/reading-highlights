- Following this helps people with 
   
- time pressures: numerals and specific data are quicker to scan read 
   
- stress: not having to decipher fractions is easier and less stressful 
   
- multi-tasking: clear, specific data is easier to absorb 
   
- cognitive impairments: numerals carry less cognitive load 
   
- visual impairments: with a limited field of visual focus, numerals may stand out more 
   
- Number presentation style affects readability and usability 
   
- Use numerals instead of words for numbers. 
   
- They are easier to scan read. It's more consistent to always use numerals rather than have a variety of rules for different sentence structures. 
   
- Choose clear typography. 
   
- choose a typeface where these characters look sufficiently different and unique. Test with users if you're not sure. 
   
- Be specific with data. 
   
- "20 people" not "20% of the survey group" 
   
- Use percentages. 
   
- Use a % sign for percentages: 50% 
   
- Use "to" for number ranges, not a hyphen. 
   
- Use "500 to 900" and not "500-900". 
   
- Use years and months not just months. 
   
- For most audiences, writing the year followed by the month is most comprehensible. 
   
- "1 year 6 months" not "18 months" 
   
- Below 1 year, use months:
  "6 months old" 
   
- Use a space before KB and MB 
   
- Use KB with a space before for anything under 1 MB. Use MB with a space before for anything over 1 MB. 
   
- Write dates without "st", "nd", "th", known as cardinals. 
   
- Do not use a comma to separate the year. Write the year in full. Spell out the month.
