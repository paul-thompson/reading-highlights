- I’ll show you how to leverage the Local Graph in Obsidian to navigate your notes. And if you prefer to watc 
   
- By making connections between notes, you are saying that these two ideas or notes have something in common and belong together 
   
- The more ideas you link together, the more they impact one another and shape the eventual output — whether that be a blog post, podcast, video, or simply your developed thoughts on a topic. 
   
- Austin Kleon helped me to realize that creativity is not coming up with something completely original. It’s simply remixing the things that you take in 
   
- When you create something, you are simply connecting the dots in ways that haven’t been connected before. 
   
- The more interesting dots you collect and connect, the more valuable the output — whether that be a blog post, a podcast episode, or simply a way of working through your thoughts on a particular topic. 
   
- Bidirectional Linking > Wiki-Style Crosslinking 
   
- bidirectional links because the link back to the referring note gets added automatically. 
   
- With a bidirectional link, the relationship between the linked notes is visible in the Linked Mentions section of both notes 
   
- visible not only in the big graph view in Obsidian but also the Local Graph.
  And this, my friends, is where the magic happens 
   
- You can access the Local Graph in Obsidian by clicking More Options for a note (the three dots in the upper-right) and selecting Open Local Graph. 
   
- The secret to making this work is to make atomic notes. The word atomic actually means “of or forming a single irreducible unit or component in a larger system.” 
   
- an atomic note is one that can’t be broken down any further 
   
- Instead of having to drill down into your folder hierarchy or search for something specific, you can stumble upon the relevant information and jump across categories by using these bidirectional links to connect the atomic notes in your library. 
   
- It does take a little more intentional effort when making notes, but the long-term payoff of being able to come at your ideas from multiple angles is worth it.
