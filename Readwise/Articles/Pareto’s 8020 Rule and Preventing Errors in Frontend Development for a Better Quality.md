- What is Pareto’s rule? 
   
- The Pareto principle states that for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes 
   
- The 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few, or the principle of factor sparsity 
   
- it has been observed that “20 percent of the code has 80 percent of the errors. 
   
- Why is it important for (Frontend) Development? 
   
- We can improve our code quality by adding strictness through modern tooling workflow, and apply best practices to avoid commonly occurring errors 
   
- What are the priorities to prevent errors? 
   
- Priority One (Pre-development) 
   
- Do not wait; the time will never be ‘just right.’ Start where you stand, and work with whatever tools you may have at your command, and better tools will be found as you go along 
   
- Customize your tools and environment based on your needs 
   
- Linting 
   
- To flag various kinds of code style errors, programming errors and some suspicious construct in the code 
   
- HTMLHint — A Static Code Analysis Tool for HTML and rules are customizable 
   
- CSS Lint: If you want to catch errors and enforce convention in your style, configure Stylelint in your workflow. It has 170 built-in rules to catch errors, apply limits and enforce stylistic conventions 
   
- SASS Lint: stylelint-scss is a plugin for stylelint, so it’s meant to be used with it. stylelint by itself supports SCSS syntax very well 
   
- ESLint is an open-source linting tool for JSX and JavaScript web applications 
   
- It allows developers to detect errors in the JS code without executing it, thus saving time. 
   
- JSHint is a flexible community-driven tool to discover errors and potential issues in your JS code. The main goal of this static code analysis tool is to help JavaScript engineers with complex programs. 
   
- Prettier can be run in your editor on-save, in a pre-commit hook, or in CI environments to ensure your codebase has a consistent style without devs ever having to post a nit-picky comment on a code review ever again 
   
- Pa11y is your automated accessibility testing pal http://pa11y.org/ 
   
- Performance optimization 
   
- Lighthouse: An open-source auditing tool that you can use to test and improve your webpage. 
   
- Sitespeed.io is a complete web performance tool that helps you measure the performance of your website 
   
- Developer Tools: All the browsers come with integrated developer tools. You should have a good command over them. 
   
- Priority Two (Development) 
   
- Take your time: Before directly jumping on writing the code, sometimes it’s best to take a step back and think about how you would implement something. 
   
- Clean code practice 
   
- Write clean and short code blocks. Wrapping things into smaller code blocks allows you to make more meaningful names.
