- First choice: to use a daily journal or not? 
   
- As far as I know, the idea of using a daily journal was first introduced to personal knowledge managers (PKM) by Roam Research. 
   
- When you write a tag it doesn’t just add some extra metadata that can be used for filtering your notes (like Gmail or Apple Notes), rather it creates a new page devoted to that tag 
   
- The power of this approach comes from the existence of a special section at the bottom of the page which lists all the blocks that link back to this page 
   
- An advantage of this system is that when you open the app you can start taking notes right away, rather than trying to first figure out where what you are writing should go, opening that page, finding the right space to put it, and then writing. 
   
- Note: If you are writing a large amount of text and don’t want to tag each line, you can just set all of it in the outline and add the tags to the top level of that section
