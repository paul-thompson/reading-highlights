- Purpose 
   
- As with any form of design, there needs to be a reason you’re creating this work 
   
- What is the issue or opportunity we’re trying to address? 
   
- What do we want our user to think, feel or do? 
   
- What research do we have to back this up? 
   
- What will success look like? 
   
- Has anything already been designed or tested?
  Are there any constraints we need to know about? 
   
- The ‘why’ often defines the ‘how’ 
   
- Context 
   
- Your content will sit with a user’s journey — no one accidentally lands on your content 
   
- Accessibility 
   
- Content design means creating something that is functional and usable — for everyone. 
   
- You need to think about various abilities and reading levels 
   
- If you do need copy, break it up with bullets, headers or subheaders, and keep it to small digestible chunks, and short sentences. 
   
- Clarity 
   
- Write in plain English, avoiding jargon at all costs 
   
- Think about everyday words and stick to those; buy instead of purchase, continue instead of proceed. You get the idea. 
   
- Keep call to action labels simple — use verbs and not passive language 
   
- Brevity 
   
- Users take in less than 30% of what they see on screen, so less is more when it comes to content. 
   
- If you can replace copy with visuals then do so — this is where content and design collaboration really helps. 
   
- Relevance 
   
- Being relevant is about being human. It’s about creating a warm and friendly welcome, having a conversation, and providing the right information at the right time. 
   
- Flexibility 
   
- Content designers shouldn’t create something, put it live and walk away.
