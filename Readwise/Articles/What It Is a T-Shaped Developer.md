- What it is a T-Shaped developer 
   
- Traditionally, organizations favoured I-shaped developers: A short of specialist that has honed a deep and pretty specific area of expertise. 
   
- Those developers, called I-Shaped developers, while experts in their area of knowledge and very productive, had a problem: Anything outside their stack was a no-mans land. 
   
- A backend developer doesn’t understand how to do UX/UI properly, a frontend developer could not solve a deploying problem. 
   
- But then organizations noticed this and solved it with the T-Shaped developer model. 
   
- besides having a defined area of expertise that goes deep in their field, they have a broad knowledge in other areas of expertise.
