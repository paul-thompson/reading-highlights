- “Merely glancing at a solution and thinking you truly know it yourself is one of the common illusions of competence in learning” – Barbara Oakley, 
   
- many Knowledge Workers are in danger of the illusions of competence by mistaking information acquisition for knowledge 
   
- gaining knowledge involves being changed by new information and being able to execute change based on that information. 
   
- “Knowledge work is work you can only do by applying things that can only be learned or best learned in a formal education process” – Peter Drucker 
   
- This might be the difference between being an Information Worker versus a Knowledge Worker.
  “In the new market we’ll be paid to do things not just know things “- Dan Appleman 
   
- information by itself provides no advantage today if it is not transformed into knowledge 
   
- We must think deeply on two questions as we are immersed in information we care about 
   
- What fresh perspective have I gained based on this information? 
   
- Am I able to change or influence someone or something based on this fresh perspective?
