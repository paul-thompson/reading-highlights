- One of the things that stands out most to me about CSS Grid is the fact that the syntax is so flexible 
   
- CSS Grid will flow the rest of the elements into their place without us having to tell it anything else 
   
- CSS Grid also allows us to name our elements using the `grid-area` property and place them on the parent element using the `grid-template-areas` property. 
   
- flexible the syntax is when it comes to creating layouts,
