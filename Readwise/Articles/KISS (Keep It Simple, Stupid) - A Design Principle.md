- It was Albert Einstein who said; “If you can’t explain it, you don’t understand it well enough.” 
   
- The phrase; “keep it simple, stupid” is thought to have been coined by the late Kelly Johnson, who was the lead engineer at the Lockheed Skunk Works (a place responsible for the S-71 Blackbird spy plane amongst many other notable achievements). It is worth noting that Kelly’s version of the phrase had no comma and was written “keep it simple stupid”. 
   
- KISS may have been the first usability principle for product design – though it was never formally presented as a usability principle. It focuses on the idea that if we can’t understand a product, we can’t use it properly and that the widest possible audience must be able to understand it, if the product is to gain maximum market share. 
   
- The KISS principle is also offered in two other forms (for those who feel delicate about the inclusion of the word “stupid”) 
   
- Keep it short and simple 
   
- Keep it simple and straightforward 
   
- Alternatives to KISS 
   
- Occam’s Razor - “Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected” (but often restated as “The simplest solution is most likely the correct solution” which is not quite the same thing). 
   
- Bjarne Stroustrup’s “Make Simple Tasks Simple!” (Stroustrup is a Danish computer scientist and highly regarded academic). 
   
- Albert Einstein’s – “Make everything as simple as possible but not simpler” (it is possible that Einstein never actually said this and it was actually a paraphrase of something he said during a lecture but the principle remains sound). 
   
- A Note of Caution When Applying KISS to Design 
   
- it is important not to let simplicity interfere with the design objective. The user must still be able to carry out their task requirements with the finished products or the design process has failed 
   
- Simplicity is a key design principle. The easier something is to understand and use – the more likely it is to be adopted and engaged with. KISS, “keep it simple, stupid” is thus a great rule of thumb to be applied when considering your design work in a larger context of usage.
