- Leading and line-height, however similar, have some important differences 
   
- An overview of typography terms 
   
- Baseline: This is the imaginary line on which the type sits 
   
- Descender: This line sits just below the baseline. It is the line that some characters — like lowercase g, j, q, y and p — touch below the baseline 
   
- X-height: This is (unsurprisingly) the height of a normal, lowercase x in a line of text. Generally, this is the height of other lowercase letters, although some may have parts of their characters that will exceed the x-height 
   
- Cap-height: This is the height of most capital letters on a given line of text. 
   
- Ascender: A line that oftentimes appears just above the cap height where some characters like a lowercase h or b might exceed the normal cap height. 
   
- Leading is defined as the distance between two baselines in a set of type. 
   
- Instead of setting the leading on a font, we get something akin to padding one either side of the line box. 
   
- Getting CSS to treat line-height like leading
