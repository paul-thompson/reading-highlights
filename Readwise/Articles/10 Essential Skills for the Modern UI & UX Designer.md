- 1. How to space objects properly 
   
- Following a convention for spacing brings uniformity to our designs and ensures that we create consistent designs while collaborating with other designers. 
   
- The most common spacing systems are the Hard grid (also called baseline grid) or Soft grid. 
   
- Hard grids align content to a fixed vertical grid, and Soft grids define the space between items on the page 
   
- Why design with spacing in increments of 8? Whether it’s a soft grid or a hard grid, it’s standard that designers space elements using 4 or 8 px 
   
- We use magic number 8 because it renders odd numbers properly 
   
- Additionally, the vast majority of modern screen dimensions are divisible by 8, making it simple to align our designs appropriately on those devices. 
   
- 2. How to pick the perfect color palette
