- Text inputs are fields that users can type free text into. They are used in forms, status updates, search fields, and more. 
   
- Styles 
   
- There are many ways to style an input field, but border and underline are the most popular ones. 
   
- Border 
   
- The classic border text field is what we think of when we create text inputs. 
   
- perfect for usability and recognizability because it has been used for so many years 
   
   - Note: Except material design doesn't
   
- Labels 
   
- The label on the text input lets the user know what they have to enter into the field. 
   
- Label text 
   
- Label text should be as short as possible. 
   
- Add any other details or instructions to the hint or placeholder text rather than the label text. 
   
- Standard label 
   
- Having the label above the input ensures that it is always visible. 
   
- Placeholder label 
   
- These text fields look very similar to the standard type, except that they use placeholder text as a label. While this is an excellent solution for space-saving, the usability isnâ€™t great as the label disappears when the user inputs text.
