- Just-in-time learning is different from structured training or scheduled professional development, both of which are generally available at set dates and times. 
   
- Just-in-time learning is an approach to individual or organizational learning and development that promotes need-related training be readily available exactly when and how it is needed by the learner. 
   
- It is timed and packaged to meet one explicit need and nothing else, so as not to overwhelm the learner with anything that does not meet the immediate need. 
   
- planning for just-in-time learning requires anticipating what is needed by the various learners, when and where they may be when they experience the need, and the creation of content oriented toward meeting those needs in ways that are focused and accessible. 
   
- It is essential that the information is findable and understandable by the person who needs it; otherwise the person will become distracted or lose focus and defeats the benefits of just-in-time learning. 
   
- one of the criteria used to assess learning is the speed of connecting the person who needs something with the learning that helps get it done.
