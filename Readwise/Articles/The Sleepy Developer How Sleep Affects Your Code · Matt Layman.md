- Is the caffeine-fueled, elite “hacker” mindset an efficient way to code? How does this person stack against the science of sleep? 
   
- You Can Be Elite Without Burning the Midnight Oil 
   
- Sleep is something that we all engage in regularly, yet many of us learn very little about it and what it really does to the body and mind. 
   
- Lack of sleep impacts 
   
- software developers from working at elite levels too 
   
- Caffeine 
   
- The most commonly used stimulant in the world is no stranger to developers 
   
- Caffeine works by interfering with adenosine receptors in the brain. Adenosine is a protein that accumulates in our brains while we’re awake 
   
- When adenosine is able to do its job, the elevated levels late in the day cause you to get drowsy and want to sleep. 
   
- caffeine blocks adenosine, the presence of the stimulant in your body can prevent easy sleep. 
   
- caffeine has a long half life of 3 to 7 hours for an average adult. In other words, a late afternoon cup of coffee at 3pm will still have half the caffeine left in you at around 8pm. 
   
- the best option for getting better sleep if you’re consuming too much caffeine is to cut back or cut off the later part of the day entirely 
   
- Light, Specifically the Blue Variety 
   
- We are biologically wired for increased wakefulness with light around. When an excess of light is present, the brain delays the release of melatonin which is a critical component in triggering the onset of sleep. 
   
- The color of the light matters! Studies show that blue light has a stronger suppressing effect on melatonin release than other light colors. 
   
- the rise of LED lights increases the amount of blue that we experience at night. LED “white” is really just equal parts of RGB (Red, Green, and Blue). 
   
- If you are using a computer at night to code without some filtering on the blue spectrum, then nighttime light may be holding you back from better sleep. 
   
- Too Much Work 
   
- Stress and mental anxiety about work can lead to sleeplessness. 
   
- Fatigue from lack of sleep can make completing work tasks more difficult or time consuming. The cycle can perpetuate. 
   
- Some work cultures incentivize behavior that keeps people working longer hours 
   
- Some workplaces have developers on a death-march pace to complete projects before certain deadlines. 
   
- Some of us work a “second day job” as maintainers of open source projects that place demands on our time 
   
- Some developers are seeking jobs. They are either doing extra training to gain the skills to break into the industry or are doing work projects that come along with many interview processes 
   
- So What? 
   
- Missing sleep impacts your ability to retain new memories. 
   
- A lack of sleep leads to cognitive impairment 
   
- If you want to code at your best, you need rest. 
   
- Write Your Best Code 
   
- Decaffeinate Part of Your Day 
   
- Latent caffeine left in your system can impair the quality of your sleep and lead to a cycle of fatigue while awake. 
   
- Leave the Blue Light Specials to Kmart 
   
- One way to suppress blue light is with blue light filtering software like f.lux. f.lux and tools like it will change the color temperature of your computer screen depending on the time of day. 
   
- Get Sleep Educated 
   
- If you want a fantastic resource about sleep, I strongly recommend Matthew Walker’s Why We Sleep.
