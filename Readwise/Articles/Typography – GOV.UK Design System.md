- Apply a heading class, such as govuk-heading-l, to style them visually. 
   
- the heading class you use does not always need to correspond to the heading level. 
   
- <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">govuk-heading-l</h1>
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">govuk-heading-m</h2>
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">govuk-heading-s</h3> 
   
- <span class="govuk-caption-xl">govuk-caption-xl</span>
  <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">govuk-heading-xl</h1> 
   
- If the caption should be considered part of the page heading, you can also nest the caption within the <h1>. 
   
- <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">
  <span class="govuk-caption-l">govuk-caption-l</span>
  govuk-heading-l
  </h1 
   
- The default paragraph font size is 19px on large screens and 16px on small screens. 
   
- Lead paragraph 
   
- A lead paragraph is an introductory paragraph that you can use at the top of a page to summarise the content. Lead paragraphs use 24px type on desktop and should only be used once per page if needed 
   
- Body small 
   
- use the govuk-body-s class sparingly to make your paragraph font size smaller: 16px on larger screens and 14px on smaller screens.
