- Start with user needs 
   
- Service design starts with identifying user needs. If you don’t know what the user needs are, you won’t build the right thing. 
   
- Don’t make assumptions. Have empathy for users, and remember that what they ask for isn’t always what they need. 
   
- Do less 
   
- If we’ve found a way of doing something that works, we should make it reusable and shareable instead of reinventing the wheel every time 
   
- Design with data 
   
- In most cases, we can learn from real world behaviour by looking at how existing services are used 
   
- Analytics should be built-in, always on and easy to read. They’re an essential tool. 
   
- Do the hard work to make it simple 
   
- Making something look simple is easy. Making something simple to use is much harder - especially when the underlying systems are complex - but that’s what we should be doing 
   
- Don’t take “It’s always been that way” for an answer. 
   
- Iterate. Then iterate again 
   
- The best way to build good services is to start small and iterate wildly. 
   
- Release minimum viable products early, test them with actual users, move from alpha to beta to live adding features, deleting things that don’t work and making refinements based on feedback. 
   
- This is for everyone 
   
- Accessible design is good design. Everything we build should be as inclusive, legible and readable as possible. 
   
- Understand context 
   
- We’re not designing for a screen, we’re designing for people. 
   
- Build digital services, not websites 
   
- A service is something that helps people to do something. 
   
- The digital world has to connect to the real world, so we have to think about all aspects of a service, and make sure they add up to something that meets user needs. 
   
- Be consistent, not uniform 
   
- We should use the same language and the same design patterns wherever possible. This helps people get familiar with our services, but when this isn’t possible we should make sure our approach is consistent. 
   
- Make things open: it makes things better 
   
- The more eyes there are on a service the better it gets - howlers are spotted, better alternatives are pointed out, the bar is raised.
