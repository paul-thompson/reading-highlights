- Branding yourself online has become increasingly important as landing a role in the tech industry is constantly getting more competitive. 
   
- Creating a strong online presence that is clearly branded will help employers and clients understand exactly what you can do for them. 
   
- Figure out exactly what you excel at and want people to know you excel at. Once you’ve decided that, you have the core foundation of your brand. Now we just need to establish it. 
   
- If you’re great at something, make it known. If you excel at the front-end, for example, share CSS tips & tricks, or perhaps some work you’ve done that you’re proud of. 
   
- Most people also mistakenly think they need to be a developer for a very long time before they would ever be suited to teach someone else something 
   
- Try to be as consistent as possible. Months of nothing followed by short bursts of posts won’t do much for you 
   
- Being able to create a small amount of content that you regularly post will perform much better for you. 
   
- Consistency about the type of content, as well as keeping it to the appropriate level of professionalism for your goal, is probably the most important aspect of branding yourself. 
   
- You don’t need to have a fancy logo or banner, or posts that are completely original and mind-blowing - you just need to make posts that are true to yourself and your desired brand. The rest can come with time.
