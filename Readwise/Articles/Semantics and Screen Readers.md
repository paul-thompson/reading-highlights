- Affordances and semantics 
   
- An affordance is any object that offers, or affords, its user the opportunity to perform an action. 
   
- When we build graphical user interfaces, we use things like CSS to add visual affordances to our UI 
   
- you need to make sure that your UI is constructed in a way that can convey these same affordances to assistive technology. This non-visual exposure of a UI element's affordances is called its semantics.
