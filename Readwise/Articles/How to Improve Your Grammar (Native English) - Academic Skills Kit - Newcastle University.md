- Grammar and academic writing 
   
- Grammar concerns the correct usage of words and how they are combined into phrases and sentences 
   
- Why are grammatical mistakes happening? 
   
- some native speakers may never have been taught the grammar of their own language formally 
   
- We all have the odd blind spot – things we’ve been writing for years and never realised were wrong 
   
- Mistakes happen! Errors can be overlooked! Not all work can be done under ideal circumstances 
   
- Some of the main causes 
   
- Sometimes readers just get the sense that something doesn’t look quite right with a piece of writing, can’t quite identify what it is, and assume it’s grammar. It might equally be an aspect of style or structure that’s just a bit unconventional 
   
- Some grammar issues are a matter of personal taste (such as the Oxford comma) 
   
- You need an editing phase. You’re already doing so much when you write: working out your ideas, planning and structuring them, thinking about how to express them, backing your points up – that trying to include grammar in all of this may lead to overload 
   
- include a phase (either as you go, or near the end) where you proofread for grammar, spelling, typos and formatting inconsistencies 
   
- What to do
