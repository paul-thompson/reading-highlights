- it might be time to pump the brakes and focus on reading comprehension. 
   
- Two basic processes happen when we read:
  The decoding process translates strings of letters into words. At the same time, language processing, or comprehension, gives meaning to those words and integrates them with our existing knowledge. We put the words and sentences into the larger context of what we’re reading. 
   
- Research shows that when people read online, they tend to browse and scan, look for keywords, and read in a less linear, more selective fashion 
   
- On the page, they tend to concentrate more on following the text. 
   
- When we read digitally, we’re more likely to move quickly, without stopping to reflect. It raises the question: does comprehension suffer when we read on a screen? 
   
- But as the researchers point out, maybe we just need better digital reading skills — especially when comprehension is our goal. 
   
- Reading for comprehension 
   
- There are two types of reading: passive and active. 
   
- Passive reading is the (mostly) mindless scanning we do when we’re scrolling Facebook or browsing a waiting room magazine. 
   
- Active reading has a purpose. We engage with the material, ask questions as we go, and consider what we’re reading. 
   
- true comprehension requires active reading 
   
- 1. Start by identifying your purpose. 
   
- Identifying our purpose helps us to stay on track and avoid mindless scanning. We can target the relevant information and skim over the rest. 
   
- 2. Remember what you’re reading. 
   
- Start by learning about the author: read the title, subtitle, front flap, and table of contents to understand the big picture 
   
- Make sure to read the introduction and the conclusion 
   
- Read or skim each chapter for relevant points 
   
- End with the table of contents again 
   
- 3. Engage with the material. 
   
- While you read, think about the material and ask yourself questions, like, “how does this relate to the author’s larger argument?” and “is the author’s reasoning effective. 
   
- Take notes, both in the margins of the book (called “marginalia”), and in a separate notebook or document 
   
- For increased retention, write a short summary of each chapter you finish, including meaningful passages and phrases 
   
- 4. Make mental links. 
   
- We need time to make mental links — to consider how each concept or idea relates to our current mental library. These links make it easier to recall what we’ve read. 
   
- 5. Reflect and summarize. 
   
- Once you finish a book, give yourself time to reflect. 
   
- This practice forces us to review our notes and reflect on the most salient points. 
   
- You can write summaries and reflections on notecards, in a journal, or an online document, but make sure they’re accessible and easy to find when you need them.
