- A Data URL is a URI scheme that provides a way to inline data in an HTML document 
   
- You could go the usual way, upload it to a folder and use the img tag to make the browser reference it from the network 
   
- or you can encode it in a special format, called Data URL, which makes it possible to embed the image directly in the HTML document, so the browser does not have to make a separate request to get it. 
   
- an image encoded as Data URL is generally a bit bigger than the same image in binary format. 
   
- A Data URL is a string that starts with data: followed by the MIME type format. 
   
- This is followed by a comma and then by the actual data
