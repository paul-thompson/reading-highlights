- Using a spreadsheet to track your job applications is a MUST. It is very easy to get lost in emails and IM messages when you are not tracking them. 
   
- The more details you have the better it will be in the long run. 
   
- Do your own job applications

- Use good timing and planning 
   
- You have to take into consideration that you also need time to prepare for interviews as well as the time to work on technical tests. 
   
- Choose quality over quantity if it's meant to be then it will be if not then there are more opportunities out there. 
   
- Have a backup plan
