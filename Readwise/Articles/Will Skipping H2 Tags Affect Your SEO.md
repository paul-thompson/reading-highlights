- Are there any implications to SEO for web pages that skip H2s and go directly from an H1 to an H3? 
   
- Probably not. 
   
- The H1 is generally known as the item on the page that has the most weight, but this is based on old school rules of HTML. 
   
- Over time, this signal became less and less important. 
   
- I still recommend that clients try to have a single H1 that uses their core keyword and at least one H2 that does, because why not do it? 
   
- But Bing (through Duane Forrester) went on record stating that they only look at the H1 and the first H2 in terms of assigning additional weight, and Google has indicated (although not said as clearly) that they use a similar strategy. 
   
- If I were you, I’d use the H1 and the H2, but it’s not a deal-breaker. 
   
- Make sure 
   
- The topic of the page is clear.
  The text is presented well.
  It renders well on mobile.
