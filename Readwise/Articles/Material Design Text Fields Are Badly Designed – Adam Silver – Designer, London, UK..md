- One topic that comes up a lot with forms is: where to put the label. 
   
- These days the focus is more about placeholders that replace labels and float labels. 
   
- Instead I recommend using conventional text fields which have 
   
- the label outside the input (to tell the user what to type) 
   
- a distinct border all the way around (to make it obvious where the answer goes) 
   
- Float labels were designed to address some problems with a commonly used alternative: placeholder labels. 
   
- Google inadvertently prioritised aesthetics over usability 
   
- The comments indicate that they tried to balance aesthetics and usability.
