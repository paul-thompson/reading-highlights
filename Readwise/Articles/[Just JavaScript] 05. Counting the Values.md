- BigInts were only recently added to JavaScript, so you won’t see them used widely yet. 
   
- in our JavaScript universe, there is an infinite number of BigInts — one for each integer in math. 
   
- Of course, in practice, we can’t fit all the possible BigInts inside the computer memory. If we tried, at some point it would crash or freeze. 
   
- Strings 
   
- Strings represent text in JavaScript. There are three ways to write strings (single quotes, double quotes, and backticks) 
   
- An empty string is a string 
   
- Strings Aren’t Objects
  All strings have a few built-in properties 
   
- trings are primitives, and all primitives are immutable 
   
- In our universe, there is a distinct value for every conceivable string 
   
- Our JavaScript universe is a model for humans, not for computers! 
   
- Whether a string is represented as a single block of memory, multiple blocks, or a rope, is up to the JavaScript engine. 
   
- To keep our mental model simple, we will say that all conceivable string values already exist from the beginning — one value for every distinct string. 
   
- Symbols 
   
- Symbols are a relatively recent addition to the language 
   
- Objects
  At last, we got to objects!
  This includes arrays, dates, RegExps, and other non-primitive values
