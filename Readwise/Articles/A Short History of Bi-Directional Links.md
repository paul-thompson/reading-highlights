- We're all very used to the mono-directional link the World Wide Web is built around. They act as one-way pointers we follow in a linear sequence. 
   
- We set up all these single direction paths, trying to signal relevance and context, only to have the other side completely ignore our efforts 
   
- We're starting to look around our mono-linked environment, and wonder why it's so hard to surface relevant, contextual relationships. 
   
- A bi-directional link has social awareness - it knows about other pages or 'nodes' that point to it, and can make them visible to people 
   
- Bi-directional links are not new 
   
- The idea of the bi-directional link goes all the way back to 1945, when
  Vannevar Bush
  dreamed up the
  Memex
  machine 
   
- He wanted a system capable of "associative indexing... whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another... [so that] numerous items have been thus joined together to form a trail." 
   
- Vannevar's evocative description of the Memex is especially impressive given that digital computers had only come into existence 5 years earlier 
   
- So the idea went into hiberation, and didn't resurface until the idea of personal computing began blooming in the sixties and seventies. 
   
- He took inspiration directly from Vannevar's essay, and in 1965 when he coined the term hypertext to describe his vision for a sprawling network of interlinking information. 
   
   - Note: Ted Nelson
   
- Nelson planned to implement these hypertextual dreams in his perpetually-imminent Project Xanadu. 
   
- The Xanadu project was a hypertext system that imagined that every sentence, block, and page would be part of a vast bi-directionally linked network. 
   
- While Sir Tim Berner's Lee
  wrote himself a note
  debating their pros and cons back in 1999, there is an obvious design issue with letting two-way connections flow freely around the web. 
   
- It became clear implementing the Web with simpler mono-directional links was the right thing to do, given that its creators wanted universal adoption

- Most of the design issues with adding bi-directional links to the global web were related to moderation and permissions 
   
- Bi-directional Linking with WebMentions 
   
- there's a way you can add bi-directionals to your personal website that picks up on references anywhere on the web. 
   
- The system notifies a URL whenever that site is mentioned elsewhere on the web. You're then able to show that mention and its contents on your site. It's essentially an opt-in bi-directional linking system.
