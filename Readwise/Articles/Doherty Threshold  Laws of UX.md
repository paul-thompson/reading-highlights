- Overview 
   
- Productivity soars when a computer and its users interact at a pace (<400ms) that ensures that neither has to wait on the other. 
   
- Takeaways 
   
- Provide system feedback within 400 ms in order to keep usersâ€™ attention and increase productivity. 
   
- Use perceived performance to improve response time and reduce the perception of waiting. 
   
- Animation is one way to visually engage people while loading or processing is happening in the background. 
   
- Progress bars help make wait times tolerable, regardless of their accuracy. 
   
- Purposefully adding a delay to a process can actually increase its perceived value and instill a sense of trust, even when the process itself actually takes much less time. 
   
- Origins 
   
- In 1982 Walter J. Doherty and Ahrvind J. Thadani published, in the IBM Systems Journal, a research paper that set the requirement for computer response time to be 400 milliseconds, not 2,000 (2 seconds) which had been the previous standard.
