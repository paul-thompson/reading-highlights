- Time to Interactive (TTI) is a performance metric that measures a page's load responsiveness and helps identify situations where a page looks interactive but actually isn't. 
   
- TTI is an important user-centric metric because it measures how quickly visitors are able to fully interact with your page 
   
- The TTI metric accounts for 10% of the total Performance Score. 
   
- Note that TTI is a companion metric to Total Blocking Time (TBT) and, together, they provide deeper insights into your page's responsiveness to user input. 
   
- How to improve Time to Interactive? 
   
- 1) Optimizing JavaScript execution 
   
- Optimize your JavaScript execution to reduce main-thread blocking time, and ensure that your page responds quickly to user inputs. 
   
- 2) Serving minimal requests 
   
- Ensure that you keep request counts as low as possible for the intended application. Similarly, avoid chaining critical requests to speed up the loading of key resources. 
   
- 3) Using resource hints to establish early connections 
   
- Use the preconnect and dns-prefetch resource hints to establish early connections to third-party servers and fetch resources sooner 
   
- Similarly, preload key requests to ensure that your visitors can use your page sooner in the page load timeline.
