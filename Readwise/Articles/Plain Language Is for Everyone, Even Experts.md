- The Myth of Plain Language 
   
- A common misguided objection I hear about plain language is that it dumbs down content and thus insults intelligent readers. 
   
- The misconceived notion that long sentences and big words make you sound smarter (or more professional) results in great sacrifices to readability and credibility. 
   
- All writers, including producers of technical and academic content, owe it to readers to communicate information simply, and clearly. 
   
- It communicates information succinctly and efficiently so that readers understand the message quickly, without having to decipher complicated sentences or vague jargon. 
   
- It is easily searchable and will often gain you a better SEO ranking. The words that you use in your copy should reflect the words people enter in search engines. 
   
- It is welcome by readers; in fact, studies show that it makes the writer look smarter. (If people understand more of what you’re saying, they will likely feel that you make sense.) 
   
- Good communication has strong business value 
   
- Organizations with clear writing styles are perceived to possess greater transparency and credibility than companies that don’t 
   
- It sets your organization apart from the competition, resulting in increased conversions and loyalty. 
   
- Forget conventions of technical writing. Push aside reports and articles that are traditionally written. They tend to be verbose and difficult to understand 
   
- If you think clearly, you will express yourself clearly. 
   
- No one has ever complained that a text was too easy to understand. 
   
- Plain language is even more important online than in person. Online copy doesn’t convey inflections well, and fast-moving Web users will miss key messages if they’re not communicated succinctly and formatted to support scanning.
