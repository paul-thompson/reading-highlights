- Summary 
   
- Task success is up substantially compared with usability statistics from 2004. Bad information architecture causes most of the remaining user failures. 
   
- getting to the right page within a website or intranet is the inevitable prerequisite to getting anything done 
   
- When users actually do find what they want, content usability obviously becomes crucial: people have to understand and like the information at their destination 
   
- IA Problems Still Prevent Task Completion 
   
- Bad IA is now the greatest cause of task failures because it's the stumbling block for getting anywhere on a site. 
   
- We usability people must continue working to eradicate the remaining task failures. But sites must also create a pleasant user experience 
   
- For most sites, improving the IA should be a top priority
