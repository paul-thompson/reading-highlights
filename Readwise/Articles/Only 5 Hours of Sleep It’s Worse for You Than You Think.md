- Denying yourself the sleep you need — and accumulating sleep debt in the process — is the surest way to short-circuit every aspect of your life. 
   
- five hours of sleep is synonymous with sleep deprivation 
   
- Why You Aren’t Actually Doing Fine on Only 5 Hours of Sleep 
   
- Your Actual Sleep Need Is Definitely More Than Five Hours 
   
- Getting only five hours of shut-eye means you aren’t meeting your biological sleep need — an individual trait that’s genetically determined, like your height or eye color. 
   
- The majority of adults need 7-9 hours of sleep per night to function optimally, with a true average of 8 hours and 10 minutes to prevent neurobehavioral impairment 
   
- older adults (aged 65 years old and above) usually need about 7-8 hours. 
   
- You’re Misinterpreting Cues 
   
- falling asleep immediately can signal extreme sleep deprivation 
   
- if you're only feeling slightly tired during the day, it's actually an indication that your body is already suffering from sleep deprivation. 
   
- You Think You Can Hack Sleep 
   
- consists of four stages: Stages 1-3 are non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep while stage 4 is REM sleep. Every night, we cycle through these stages roughly 4-6 times, averaging 90 minutes in each stage 
   
- that sleep restriction over one night, or multiple nights consecutively, preserves slow-wave sleep (stage 3) while reducing stage 1, stage 2, and REM sleep 
   
- Since REM sleep is needed for vital functions like memory consolidation and problem-solving, shortening this sleep stage will likely lead to a cognitive decline in your waking moments. 
   
- Your Brain and Body Are Tricking You 
   
- As humans, we adapt biologically within a few nights of short sleep. You may think you’re doing fine, but in reality, your performance is in decline
