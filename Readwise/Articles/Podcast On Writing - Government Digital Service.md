- A year on from launching the GDS podcast, senior creative writers Angus Montgomery and Sarah Stewart talk about their jobs. 
   
- here are Angus and Sarah’s 10 tips for clear writing 
   
- Establish ‘The Point’ 
   
- Keep The Point close to you as you write. It’ll keep you focused, concise and motivated. 
   
- Write it like you’d say it 
   
- If you’re trying to describe a difficult technical concept, then explain as you would to a friend. Try saying the sentence out loud before you write it down 
   
- Don’t try to sound clever 
   
- Don’t use ornate sentence constructions or complex words. Don’t use acronyms or jargon either 
   
- Show the thing 
   
- If you’re trying to tell someone about a product or a service, show it 
   
- Know that you are not your writing 
   
- it is a separate entity. Once you understand that, negative feedback won’t derail you. You will view your work dispassionately, and be better able to focus on making your writing as clear and effective as it can be 
   
- Share your work 
   
- Sharing your work will give you the clarity and perspective you lack if you write in isolation 
   
- Read (poetry in particular) 
   
- Poetry in particular can teach you about conveying complex ideas in a limited space. It can also teach you about the music of a sentence and how a piece scans. 
   
- Never start with a blank page 
   
- A blank page can be daunting. So write something down 
   
- Know when enough is enough 
   
- Have you achieved what you set out to do? If you have, step away from the doc 
   
- Stay human 
   
- When you write, you (a human being) are conveying an idea to another human being. Writing is a skill that takes time to develop so don’t be too hard on yourself
