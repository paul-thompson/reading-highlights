- What makes writing more readable? 
   
- Writing text that can be understood by as many people as possible seems like an obvious best practice 
   
- Plain language—a style of writing that uses simplified sentences, everyday vocabulary, and clear structure—aims to remove those barriers. 
   
- Plain language is useful for everyone, but especially for those who are often denied the opportunity to engage with and comment on public writin 
   
- How do algorithms try to assess readability? 
   
- Though most readability formulas were designed to offer rough difficulty estimates for specific groups of readers, their usage varies greatly, 
   
- Moreover, the simplicity of readability checkers has enabled their widespread adoption. Military engineers use them to help write technical documents. Governments and doctors use them to guide communication for a general audience. Schools and textbook manufacturers use them to tailor reading assignments to particular grade levels and students. 
   
- Algorithm #1: Syllable Count 
   
- The Flesch-Kincaid Grade level formula looks, in part, at syllable count, based on the idea that words with fewer syllables are easier to understand. 
   
- The two factors considered by Flesch–Kincaid are number of words per sentence and number of syllables per word. 
   
- Algorithm #2: Difficult words 
   
- The Dale-Chall Readability Formula considers the proportion of difficult words, where it deems a word “difficult” if it is not on a list of 3,000 words familiar to fourth-grade students. 
   
- One risk in the use of vocabulary lists is that the vocabulary of the readers surveyed to create them may not match the vocabulary of the intended audience 
   
- Algorithm #3: Algorithmic black boxes 
   
- the Lexile Framework for Reading, a set of readability algorithms and vocabulary lists designed to automatically match students with appropriately difficult books 
   
- The approach sounds simple enough, but critics have pointed out absurdities in Lexile's results 
   
- Formulas based on surface level text properties and word frequency have clear limitations. None of them consider how well organized the information is, or whether the sentences and paragraphs are coherent. 
   
- None consider the role of grammatical tense. None account for the explanation of acronyms and jargon. 
   
- Lexile has some of the most disconcerting aspects of both worlds. As flawed as Flesch-Kincaid or Dale-Chall, but opaque and unexplainable. 
   
- Technology alone isn’t the answer. Even the most thoughtful algorithms and robust data sets lack context. Ultimately, the effectiveness of plain language translations comes down to engagement with your audience.
