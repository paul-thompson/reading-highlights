- Bad Search 
   
- Search is the user's lifeline when navigation fails. Even though advanced search can sometimes help, simple search usually works best, and search should be presented as a simple box, since that's what users are looking for. 
   
- PDF Files for Online Reading 
   
- Worst of all, PDF is an undifferentiated blob of content that's hard to navigate. 
   
- Not Changing the Color of Visited Links 
   
- A good grasp of past navigation helps you understand your current location, since it's the culmination of your journey 
   
- Users can exclude links that proved fruitless in their earlier visits. Conversely, they might revisit links they found helpful in the past 
   
- When visited links don't change color, users exhibit more navigational disorientation in usability testing and unintentionally revisit the same pages repeatedly. 
   
- Non-Scannable Text 
   
- A wall of text is deadly for an interactive experience. Intimidating. Boring. Painful to read. 
   
- To draw users into the text and support scannability, use well-documented tricks 
   
- subheads
  bulleted lists
  highlighted keywords
  short paragraphs
  the inverted pyramid
  a simple writing style, and
  de-fluffed language devoid of marketese 
   
- Fixed Font Size 
   
- Respect the user's preferences and let them resize text as needed. Also, specify font sizes in relative terms â€” not as an absolute number of pixels. 
   
- Page Titles With Low Search Engine Visibility 
   
- Search is the most important way users discover websites. Search is also one of the most important ways users find their way around individual websites. 
   
- Search engines typically show the first 66 characters or so of the title, so it's truly microcontent. 
   
- Anything That Looks Like an Advertisement 
   
- users also ignore legitimate design elements that look like prevalent forms of advertising. 
   
- Web users have learned to stop paying attention to any ads that get in the way of their goal-driven navigation 
   
- Violating Design Conventions 
   
- Consistency is one of the most powerful usability principles: when things always behave the same, users don't have to worry about what will happen 
   
- Opening New Browser Windows 
   
- Don't pollute my screen with any more windows, thanks (particularly since current operating systems have miserable window management 
   
- Links that don't behave as expected undermine users' understanding of their own system. 
   
- Not Answering Users' Questions 
   
- Users are highly goal-driven on the Web. They visit sites because there's something they want to accomplish 
   
- The worst example of not answering users' questions is to avoid listing the price of products and services. 
   
- Price is the most specific piece of info customers use to understand the nature of an offering, and not providing it makes people feel lost and reduces their understanding of a product line.
