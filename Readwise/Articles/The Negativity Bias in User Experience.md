- Summary: People remember the bad more than the good. Users’ tendency to identify flaws in designs raises the bar for what they consider acceptable. 
   
- The negativity bias is the tendency for humans to pay more attention, or give more weight to negative experiences over neutral or positive experiences 
   
- UX Considerations 
   
- A single usability flaw on your site will weigh more than the many positive features 
   
- Our research shows that websites have improved over the years, yet users’ satisfaction ratings have remained the same — for two reasons: (1) UX failures count more than UX successes; (2) people judge a site by comparing it with other sites that they’ve encountered 
   
- If being usable is the norm, then sites and apps must be exceptional to be memorable and noteworthy. 
   
- Follow design standards 
   
- Anticipate users’ concerns and address them: Pleasant encounters come in all forms and sizes 
   
- Match workflows to user expectations: Users have mental models of how the system should behave and what steps should be involved in completing tasks. 
   
- Microcopy, small bits of copy that provide instructions or alleviate concerns, can significantly boost positive impressions and prevent negative ones from ever forming 
   
- Microcopy can make a huge impact when it is presented just in time, in context, is easy to understand, and possesses the proper tone of voice. 
   
- Write good error messages: Despite your best efforts to create an enjoyable user experience, websites sometimes need error messages to help people resolve unavoidable issues. 
   
- Sprinkle delightful encounters: As insurance, counteract negative experiences with delightful ones 
   
- Test, test, and then test: Focus on designing usable websites that solve users’ problems. Understand your users and their tasks, and go out of your way to iron out as many usability hurdles (negative encounters) as you can in order to make it easy for people to reach their goals. 
   
- A core tenet of usability is recognizing that you are not your user 
   
- Conclusion 
   
- Functionality and usability in user interfaces are required for success and should be your priority. 
   
- Account for negativity bias by going beyond user expectations and strive for delightful experiences.
