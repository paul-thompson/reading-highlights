- Most people make this mistake, with engineers and developers on Twitter, where they assume the number of followers they have must correlate with how good of an engineer they are. 
   
- You don't get much serious thinking done when you can focus on something for 25 minutes max before you're off riding the dopamine rollercoaster again 
   
   - Note: Deep working
   
- Paradoxically, the less I use Twitter, the better I am at my day job, but also the less likely I am to get approached with opportunities to change my day job 
   
- The reason I have that many followers is that I spent several years tweeting regularly 
   
- But most of my follower growth results from tweeting and interacting with other tweets.
