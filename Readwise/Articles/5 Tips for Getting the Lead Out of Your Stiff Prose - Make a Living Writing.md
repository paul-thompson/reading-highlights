- Watching your tone 
   
- How can you get the lead out and create a livelier piece that hooks editors and readers alike? 
   
- Use contractions 
   
- “She’s got a bakery that’ll make whatever you like” instead of “She has a bakery that will make whatever you like.” The latter is stiff and feels too formal. 
   
- Be conversational 
   
- articles that are written in a friendly, conversational style. Avoid jargon wherever possible and speak in plain English. 
   
- read your piece out loud. If it flows when spoken, you’re probably doing well. 
   
- Be more concise. 
   
- Long sentences full of semicolons that go on for a half-dozen lines are intimidating for readers. 
   
- they want the best, most concise, fact-filled, interest-packed words you’ve got 
   
- Review your draft and trim out any words, phrases, or sentences that don’t add anything 
   
- Avoid being verbs. 
   
- Passive verbs make your writing snoozy and uninvolving 
   
- Use anecdotes and quotes
