- the most underutilized factor in achieving higher productivity and effectiveness in the workplace is the management of internal energy. 
   
- Managing Your Energy is the Key to High Performance 
   
- Work in 90 Minute Time Blocks 
   
- Humans are not machines. We work and think best in short sprints rather than long marathons 
   
- Each day, block off time in your calendar to work on specific results 
   
- Focus all of your energy on this result during this specified time, nothing else. 
   
- Manage Your Energy and Attention 
   
- Keep your spine straight. Many of us hunch our bodies over our desk. This collapses the lungs and reduces oxygenation. Less oxygen translates to faster fatigue. More fatigue equals less focus. 
   
- Any tensions we hold due to stress saps our energy and reduces our focus. The more conscious we become of these tensions, the more they will resolve naturally. 
   
- Learn to meditate. It will help you build greater reserves of energy and enable you to maintain a deeper focus. 
   
- Stay hydrated. Drink water. Hydration is fundamental for healthy bodily functioning. Dehydration leads to fatigue 
   
- Eliminate External Distractions 
   
- Every time your attention gets pulled away from the task at hand, it takes more energy to return to that task 
   
- we can greatly reduce most distractions when we are working on something important during our time blocks. 
   
- Eliminate the following common attention-killers when you’re working on an important task: 
   
- Close your email program.
  Shut off your smart phone or put it on airplane mode.
  Exit all unnecessary browsers and other programs on your desktop.
  Close your office door. 
   
- Technology owns us until we master it. Every ding and beep on our phones triggers the reward center of our brain, which makes it difficult to ignore. Eliminate this persistent source of distraction when you’re working towards a result. This one strategy can be a game-changer. 
   
- Rest and Recover 
   
- After you complete a period of intense focus and effort, allow your mind to wander. 
   
- For every 90 minutes of work, allow up to 30 minutes for rest and recovery 
   
- During periods of recovery, you can 
   
- Practice deep breathing.
  Meditate: focus your attention on your breath.
  Listen to music you enjoy.
  Go for a walk outside.
  Have a low-sugar energy snack and chat with colleagues.
  Take a power nap.
  Stretch and move around.
  Play. Toss a ball around the office. Throw a frisbee with a coworker.
