- a computer science professor at Georgetown University. In addition to my academic research, I write about the intersection of digital technology and culture 
   
- The Deep Work Hypothesis 
   
- The ability to concentrate without distraction on a demanding task 
   
- those individuals and organizations who put in the hard work to cultivate this skill will thrive. 
   
- Digital Minimalism 
   
- you should radically reduce the time you spend online, focusing on a small number of activities chosen because they support things you deeply value 
   
- Attention Capital Theory 
   
- the primary capital resource is human brains; or, more specifically, these brains’ ability to create new value through sustained attention. 
   
- Career Capital Theory 
   
- “Follow your passion” is bad advice if your goal is to end up loving what you do for a living 
   
- work deliberately to develop rare and valuable skills, and then use the resulting “career capital” to shape your career into something that truly resonates
