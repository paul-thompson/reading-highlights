- this fact is why learning to read specifications is so useful. If something is behaving in a way other than you expected, you can take a look at the spec and see what instructions the browser engineers were following when implementing that feature 
   
- unless you know *how* something is supposed to work you can’t know if it is not working correctly. 
   
- If you completely rely on learning from tutorials written by other people then you always get your knowledge second hand, filtered through what they felt was important you know
