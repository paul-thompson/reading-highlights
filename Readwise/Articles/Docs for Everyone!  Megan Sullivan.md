- Tip #1: Expose the architecture 
   
- As a documentarian, it’s your job to provide new users with a clear map and signposts that they can use to navigate the content of your docs. 
   
- Define the architecture 
   
- The Diátaxis framework splits up documentation into four different categories 
   
- Tutorials: Hold the reader’s hand through their first experience with your product. These are specifically tailored for newcomers who may not know anything about your product or how it work 
   
- How-To Guides: Practical step-by-step guides to help readers accomplish a specific task. 
   
- Reference: Describes the technical details of how your product works (like an API spec or a user manual).
