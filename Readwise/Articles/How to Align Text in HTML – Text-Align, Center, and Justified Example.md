- Remember that it's essential to always handle all stylings with CSS. You should use HTML only to add markup to your web page. 
   
- text-align: start;
  text-align: end;
  text-align: left;
  text-align: right;
  text-align: center;
  text-align: justify; 
   
- start: This is based on the direction. When the direction is left-to-right, start would mean left. If the direction is right-to-left, then start would mean right. 
   
- end: This is also based on the direction. When the direction is left-to-right, then end would mean right. If the direction is right-to-left, then end would mean left. 
   
- left: You use this to align the texts to the left edge of the page or container 
   
- right: You use this to align the texts to the right edge of the page or container. 
   
- center: You use this to align the texts to the perfect center of the page or container. 
   
- justify: You use this to adjust the text content to touch the left and right edges of your page or container.
