- Nobody gets particularly excited about breadcrumbs. Those tiny little crumbles that illustrate where a user currently is in the intricate hierarchy of the website 
   
- Breadcrumbs Work Best Under Global Navigation 
   
- To help users understand where they are, breadcrumbs need to be visible to users. Ideally, we would place them right under the main navigation, or at least above the headings, easy to spot, find and use 
   
- The primary navigation, the breadcrumbs, the sidebar and tabs. Users can jump between various levels, go backwards with breadcrumbs, move forward with horizontal navigation, move sideways with the sidebar navigation and switch contexts within sections with tabs. 
   
- Avoid “Disabled” Breadcrumbs 
   
- the general expectation is very clear: all breadcrumbs should be links, except the last one 
   
- Breadcrumbs Should (Probably) Point To The Right 
   
- we usually consider browsing through pages as a horizontal experience on a timeline, we usually move from left to right. 
   
- Distinguish Between Links and Text Labels 
   
- Showing Current Page Might Be Unnecessary 
   
- If breadcrumbs live close to the main heading of the page, repeating them in breadcrumbs might be unnecessary. 
   
- On Mobile, Use Breadcrumbs Accordions 
   
- Websites with many levels of navigation often don’t have space to display the entire path with breadcrumbs 
   
- Curtain Reveal Breadcrumbs 
   
- Another approach on mobile is to try to show as much as possible with an option to show/hide breadcrumbs. 
   
- swipe left and right, or by encouraging users to tap around to the point of interest 
   
- Use Sideways Breadcrumbs 
   
- breadcrumbs are sort of extended — with a drop-down that allows users to jump to other sections within the category quickly 
   
- the design pattern per se is useful since it significantly speeds up jumps between siblings. 
   
- Wrapping Up 
   
- Breadcrumbs alone aren’t enough. The aren’t sufficient to navigate the site easily and always complement existing navigation patterns, but can’t really 
   
- Every time we design breadcrumbs, we need to keep them visible without scrolling, create a clear relationship with the main heading and maximize the speed of interaction from intent to result. Not many components can do it as well as breadcrumbs do, so keep them close in your toolbox.
