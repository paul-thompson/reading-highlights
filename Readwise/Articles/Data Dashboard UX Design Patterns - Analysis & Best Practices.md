- In data-heavy industries, it’s easy for software to feel overwhelming. 
   
- Why do dashboards matter? 
   
- It’s a page that allows you to take the pulse of recent activity, recognize patterns, identify trends and changes over time. Dashboards should provide clarity through prioritized and actionable insights 
   
- Why are dashboards relevant to Enterprise? 
   
- Dashboards offer an at-a-glance snapshot and prevent users from having to check 10,000 screens just to “know what’s up”. 
   
- Things to consider 
   
- Is the data clean enough? 
   
- Is the data maintainable? Is the metadata consistent and scalable? Start with prompts like these 
   
- Is the data tracked over time?
  How much historical data do we have? (years, months etc)
  Can we calculate if/when statements to create insights? 
   
- Map out user context 
   
- If the divergences are small enough, creating multiple unique versions might not be necessary. But if they are large, you should consider catering to separate personas. 
   
- Determine dashboard goals 
   
- What needs their attention?
  What do they need to report on?
  What deserves a spot on the dashboard?
  What are the most global metrics that deserve higher visibility?
  What needs to be visualized?
  What personas/scenarios does this dashboard need to be catered to? 
   
- Find out what is taking the most time for users to compile 
   
- Is the data relevant over time? 
   
- Are there better ways to represent it? (Ratio (pie-chart), totals, averages (lists), deltas (diffs), etc.) 
   
- Is the data captured in a way that you can represent with graphs? 
   
- Anatomy of a dashboard 
   
- At the high-level, the page should consist of your navigation (duh), a filter area (top or side) and the content area made of sections 
   
- try to keep the scroll length limited to a single page. 
   
- we should sense distinct sections. Group related stuff together. Consider the styling of your text headers to communicate a clear hierarchy. 
   
- Inside these sections are where your modules live — the meat of the dashboard. Modules are the grouped entity of a chart or graph or list accompanied by its title, key values, labels, legend and other accessories. They often live inside a “card” design but can also work well as floating elements. 
   
- Layout patterns for dashboards 
   
- Intuitive page layout
