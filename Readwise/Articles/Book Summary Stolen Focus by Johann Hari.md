- 3 Big Ideas from Stolen Focus by Johann Hari 
   
- We now live in ‘an attentional pathogenic culture’ – an environment in which sustained and deep focus is extremely hard for all of us, and you have to swim upstream to achieve it 
   
- Attention spans are decreasing at the time we need them most 
   
- When attention breaks down, problem-solving breaks down. 
   
- Most office workers never get an hour to themselves without being interrupted 
   
- Empathy is one of the most complex forms of attention we have – and the most precious. Many of the most important advances in human history have been advances in empathy 
   
- It’s not your fault you can’t focus. It’s by design. The truth is that you are living in a system that is pouring acid on your attention every day, and then you are being told to blame yourself 
   
- Your difficulty in focusing is a system problem. The big tech companies have designed an environment to steal your attention 
   
- Six things Johann Hari has done to improve his attention 
   
- Use pre-commitment to stop switching tasks so much 
   
- Don't listen to negative self-talk - You’re lazy, you’re not good enough, what’s wrong with you? 
   
- Take extended times away from social media. Johann takes six months of the year totally off it 
   
- Embrace mind-wandering. Letting your mind wander is not a crumbling of attention but in fact a crucial form of attention in its own right. 
   
- Sleep is not a luxury. It is essential for sustained focus. 
   
- Embrace play and unstructured free time. 
   
- Solving big problems requires the sustained focus of many people over many years. 
   
- Three ways task switching degrades your focus 
   
- Switching cost - You lose focus switching between tasks 
   
- Screw-up effect. When you switch between tasks, errors that wouldn’t have happened otherwise start to creep in 
   
- Creativity drain - In the long run, you are likely to be much less creative. 
   
- A digital detox is ‘not the solution, for the same reason that wearing a gas mask for two days a week outside isn’t the answer to pollution
