- Having this skill will not just improve your career, it will also improve your relationships with other people. 
   
- Why you should give feedback? 
   
- There are two types of feedback. Positive and negative. Both of them have the same goal which is to improve the situation or the person's performance. 
   
- By giving people feedback you make them grow. Often it involves criticism, but when it is given in the right way, it can help them evolve. 
   
- Ideal feedback formula 
   
- COIN Conversation Model 
   
- COIN stands for Context, Observation, Impact, and Next steps 
   
- Context - define the situation
  Observation - describe the behavior
  Impact - clarify the impact
  Next steps - make a suggestion 
   
- Do not avoid giving feedback because you are afraid to upset another person. You cannot control the mood of the person you are giving your feedback to, but you will encourage honesty in the group and potentially fix the problem that another person cooperates with. 
   
- Feedback receiver maturity 
   
- Not everyone is used to receive feedback and maybe you too. 
   
- There are different levels 
   
   - Note: feedback staircase
