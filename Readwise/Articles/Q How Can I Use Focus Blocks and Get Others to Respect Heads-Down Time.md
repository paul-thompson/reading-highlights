- In a nutshell, focus blocks are blocks of time free of meetings or other distractions. Their purpose is to reduce context switching and increase the time for doing work only you can do. 
   
- when you’re completely immersed in an activity and even lose track of time or temporary needs such as food, thereby increasing the quality or volume (or both) of your output. Most important, I’ve observed team members feel greater satisfaction in their work and greater control over their schedule as flow states increase. 
   
- Pro tip: block times in 30 or 60 minute increments, rather than 2 to 3 hours, as they look more like meetings to would-be overschedulers.
