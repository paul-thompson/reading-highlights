- Instead of taking the knowledge that the author has imparted and applying it to their context, they will put that responsibility on the author’s shoulders. People aren’t thinking for themselves. 
   
- I should think for myself here, consider my needs and my context to reach an informed decision for myself. It’s not the author’s fault that my circumstances are different to the ones they wrote for 
   
- Things are often written with one, known context in mind; if you’re throwing the curveballs then the onus is on you to think about them for yourselves, and share any thoughts of findings you arrive at. We need to think for ourselves. 
   
- perhaps it won’t work on a big site, but perhaps that’s not the intended context… 
   
- New ideas and methods should be examined, questioned and rigorously tested, but if you’re the one with the unusual circumstances or the different context then consider doing your own testing, rather than passing it back to the original author with an air of ‘doesn’t work’.
