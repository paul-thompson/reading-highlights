- One thing is a constant though.
  I rarely look at them again! 
   
- d the idea of personal knowledge management (PKM). This is the idea of collecting and classifying your thoughts so that they can be easily retrieved but also help you to make sense out of them. 
   
- Using Obsidian for the last 4 or 5 months has really helped me to organise my notes and has started me on a journey to creating new ideas from concepts I find rather than letting the notes wither away and die. 
   
- What is Obsidian? 
   
- Obsidian is a tool which gives you "a second brain, forever". It's a linked knowledge base similar to Roam Research, but it allows you to store your own Markdown files on your computer rather than in the cloud 
   
- One of the great ideas behind Obsidian and Roam Research is the idea of linked notes. 
   
- Obsidian backlinks 
   
- Most links are mono-directional and just point to that new page. Backlinks allow bi-directional linking. 
   
- Obsidian backlinks are created using the Wikilink format using double brackets. 
   
- By default, Obsidian will link to a new note but it won't create it until you follow the link. Pressing CMD + click (Mac) or CTRL + click (Windows) on the link will take you to a new page and then the note is created in your vault. 
   
- Linked and unlinked mentions 
   
- Linked mentions are when you explicitly link to a page using the [[backlink]] format. 
   
- Unlinked mentions are when you mention the page in another note but you don't directly link to it. Using these mentions, you can quickly see how ideas are related 
   
- Tags 
   
- Obsidian allows you to use tags. Adding tags to a note can make them easier to find in searches if you have a large vault of notes. 
   
- Graph view 
   
- Obsidian allows you to create an unlimited vault of notes but its power comes in linking these together
