- Once my mentor told me that soft skills are very important, and before programmers, we are people, we are humans 
   
- Ask dummy questions. 
   
- There are a million technologies. And you're not expected to know them all, so ask! 
   
- Be kind 
   
- Radiate kindness. You're going to go far. 
   
- Take advantage of what other people are doing 
   
- Look for existing solutions before starting a task. Understand the coding paradigms used. Look at your team's code 
   
- Do the right thing 
   
- Take pride in your work, don't just make it work. Make it work the best way you can. 
   
- Find your way, fight for yourself 
   
- your day should start with the high-impact task. Fight for yourself, make yourself grow, no one else will do it for you. 
   
- Look for critics in your code 
   
- Make code review. Review your code as much as possible, the more constructive feedback you get, the faster you will learn and grow. 
   
- Put your ego aside 
   
- Be empathetic, be open-minded, learn from your team, even when they are wrong. 
   
- Take initiative 
   
- Look for opportunities to improve process and experience development of your team and project 
   
- Improve documentation, learn from your mentors and teach others. Be a mentor too! Become the person you wanted to have as a mentor when you started as a junior 
   
- Throw yourself into the fire 
   
- We will never be ready to work on large projects or new features, deploy in production, manage implementations... the best way to prepare for them is to do them!
  You will expand your comfort zone. And you'll grow a lot! 
   
- Intention, always intention. 
   
- Make sure that behind every line of code there is purpose, intention and clarity.
