- Users with low literacy 
   
- Less is more 
   
- Sometimes content writers are asked to include as much detail as possible to make sure every angle has been covered. 
   
- This can be a disaster for users with low literacy who can struggle to 
   
- identify the main points in large blocks of text
  concentrate on reading for long periods of time
  retain the information they’re reading as they read it 
   
- You can help people of all literacy levels understand what they need to know by 
   
- only including content that meets a specific user need
  organising information into manageable chunks
  using bullet points to break up long lists 
   
- Punctuation can slow people down 
   
- Content designers must write for quick and easy reading. 
   
- We have to remember that it can be hard to read things like 
   
- capital letters
  contractions, eg ‘would’ve’
  apostrophes 
   
- Readers with low literacy often don’t recognise the meaning of certain types of punctuation at a glance, eg an apostrophe showing possession 
   
- Using common words and simple sentence structures can have a big impact on reading speed 
   
- Be direct
