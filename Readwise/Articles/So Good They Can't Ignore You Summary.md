- Don’t do what you love, but learn to love what you do. 
   
- Become a craftsman to collect the skills you need 
   
- Say no to a raise to keep control of your work. 
   
- Cal says that whether you love your work or not is mostly based on expertise and experience. 
   
- according to self determination theory, intrinsic motivation, which we often connect with passion and being satisfied at work, comes from three things 
   
- Autonomy – some sense of control over your time 
   
- Competence – the feeling that you’re good at your work 
   
- Relatedness – connecting with other people in the process 
   
- Once you start listening to Steve Martin and try to “be so good they can’t ignore you”, you’ll be so busy trying to deliver quality work that you won’t even have the time to deliberate what your true calling is. 
   
- Deliberate practice is the way to develop the autonomy and competence you need to boost your intrinsic motivation levels 
   
- When you become a craftsman you’ll seek out those problems at work which you can almost solve, but not quite. This will help you focus on developing new skills while staying motivated, until you eventually become such a master that you’ll begin to love your work. 
   
- when you get to make your own hours, or spread a project over 6 months in any way you like, you’ll feel competent and more motivated. 
   
- as soon as you gain more control over your time and work, someone will try to take it from you.
