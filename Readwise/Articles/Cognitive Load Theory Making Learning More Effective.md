- Don't overload your brain when you want to learn better. 
   
- How Do We Process Information 
   
- Cognitive Load Theory builds upon the widely accepted model of human information processing 
   
- It describes the process as having three main parts: sensory memory, working memory and long-term memory. 
   
- Sensory memory filters out most of this information, but keeps an impression of the most important items long enough for them to pass into working memory. 
   
- Information from your sensory memory passes into your working memory, where it is either processed or discarded. 
   
- Working memory can generally hold between five and nine items (or chunks) of information at any one time. 
   
- When your brain processes information, it categorizes that information and moves it into long-term memory, where it is stored in knowledge structures called "schemas." 
   
- The more practiced you become at using these schemas, the more effortless these behaviors become. This is called "automation." Schemas are also significant to Cognitive Load Theory 
   
- What Is Cognitive Load Theory? 
   
- "Cognitive load" relates to the amount of information that working memory can hold at one time. 
   
- since working memory has a limited capacity, instructional methods should avoid overloading it with additional activities that don't directly contribute to learning. 
   
- Cognitive Load Theory also shows us that working memory can be extended in two ways 
   
- the mind processes visual and auditory information separately. Auditory items in working memory do not compete with visual items in the same way that two visual items, for example a picture and some text, compete with one another. 
   
- This is known as the "Modality Effect." So, for example, explanatory information has less impact on working memory if it is narrated, rather than added to an already complex diagram. 
   
- Second, working memory treats an established schema as a single item, and a highly practiced "automated" schema barely counts at all. 
   
- learning activities that draw upon your existing knowledge expand the capacity of your working memory. 
   
- pre-training, or teaching people prerequisite skills before introducing a more complex topic, will help them establish schemas that extend their working memory; 
   
- Applying Cognitive Load Theory to Training and Learning 
   
- Cognitive Load Theory helps you design training that reduces the demands on learners' working memory, so that they learn more effectively. 
   
- Measure Expertise and Adapt Presentation Accordingly 
   
- The more expertise you develop in a particular area, the more information you have available in your schemas 
   
- it doesn't matter how complex a schema is â€“ it counts as a single item in your working memory. 
   
- Reduce the Problem Space 
   
- The "problem space" is the gap between the current situation and the desired goal. If this is too large, people's working memory becomes overloaded. 
   
- Focusing on the goal also takes attention away from the information being learned, which makes learning less effective. 
   
- A better approach is to break the problem down into parts. This reduces the problem space and lightens the cognitive load, making learning more effective. 
   
- Other methods of reducing the problem space include providing worked examples and presenting problems with partial solutions for the learner to complete. 
   
- Reduce Split-Attention Effect 
   
- When you have multiple sources of visual information, such as diagrams, labels and explanatory text, your attention is divided between them.
