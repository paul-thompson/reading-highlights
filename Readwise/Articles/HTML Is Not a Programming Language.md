- HTML is not a programming language. 
   
- HTML is a markup language, not a programming language 
   
- markup languages can be programming languages. Not all of them are (most are not) but they can be. 
   
- A markup language that operates with variables, has control structures, loops, etc., would also be a programming language. They are not mutually exclusive concepts. 
   
- TeX and LaTeX are examples of markup languages that are also considered programming languages 
   
- The point is that the original statement is wrong: markup languages can be programming languages 
   
- HTML doesn’t have logic 
   
- This claim demands that we clarify what “logic” means because the definition might just surprise you. 
   
- I’ve asked people to tell me what they mean by “logic” and have gotten interesting answers back like:
  Logic is a sensible reason or way of thinking. 
   
- Programming languages have variables, conditions, loops, etc. HTML is not a programming language because you can’t use variables or conditions. It has no logic. 
   
- HTML does have variables — in the form of attributes — and there are control structures that can be used along with those variables/attributes to determine what is displayed. 
   
- There are some HTML elements that have internal control logic and don’t require JavaScript or CSS to work. 
   
- I’m referring to elements that will respond to the user input and perform conditional actions depending on the current state of the element and the value of a variable. Take the <details>/<summary> tuple or the <dialog> element as examples: when a user clicks on them, they will close if the open attribute is present, and they will open if it is not. No JavaScript required.

- So just saying alone that HTML isn’t a programming language because it lacks logic is misleading. We know that HTML is indeed capable of making decisions based on user input. 
   
- HTML has logic, but it is inherently different from the logic of other languages that are designed to manipulate data. 
   
- HTML is not ‘Turing complete’ 
   
- It’s technically correct (the best kind of correct) to say HTML is not Turing complete, but it should spark a bigger debate than just using it as a case-closing statement. 
   
- In the simplest terms, for a language or machine to be Turing complete, it means that it is capable of doing what a Turing machine could do: perform any calculation, a.k.a. universal computation. After all, programming was invented to do math although we do a lot more with it now, of course! 
   
- Because most modern programming languages are Turing complete, people use that as the definition of a programming language 
   
- Turing-completeness is not that. It is a criterion to identify if a system (or its ruleset) can simulate a Turing machine. It can be used to classify programming languages; it doesn’t define them 
   
- The definition of what programming is (or is not) changes with time. I bet someone sorting through punched cards complained about how typing code in assembly was not real programming. There’s nothing universal or written in stone. There’s no actual definition. 
   
- Turing-completeness is a fair standard, I must say, but one that is biased and subjective 
   
- Why is it that a language capable of generating a Turing Complete Machine gets riveted as a “programming language” while another capable of generating a Finite State Machine is not? 
   
- It is just a way to categorize programming languages — to group them, not define them. A programming language could be Turing complete or not in the same way that it could be interpreted or compiled, imperative or declarative, procedural or object-oriented. 
   
- we must be wary of this question as, in many cases, it is not used to spark a serious debate but to stir controversy while hiding ulterior motives: from getting easy Internet reactions, to dangerously diminishing the contribution of a group of people to the development ecosystem. 
   
- HTML is the backbone of the Internet. It’s a beautiful language with vast documentation and extensive syntax, yet so simple that it can be learned in an afternoon, and so complex that it takes years to master. Programming language or not, what really matters is that we have HTML in the first place.
