- This is a fair warning to myself and other technical content generators that your example code will likely end up in production, no matter how many alerts, notes, comments, and admonitions you make 
   
- Facilitate rapid prototyping 
   
- rarely do I see situations where prototypes are chucked in the bin and not evolved into production 
   
- Target an MVP 
   
- Give devs building blocks so that each step of the way through your how-to or documentation they can build on their foundational knowledge but don't be afraid to keep it lean
