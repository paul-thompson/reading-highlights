- Flexbox wrapping 
   
- when there is not enough space, those child items won’t wrap into a new line by default. We need to change that behavior with flex-wrap: wrap. 
   
- A general rule of thumb when using flexbox is to allow wrapping unless you want a scrolling wrapper. That’s another thing, but try to use flex-wrap to avoid unexpected layout behaviors (horizontal scrolling, in our case).
