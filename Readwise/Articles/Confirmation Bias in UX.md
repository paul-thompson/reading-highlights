- Summary: People tend to prefer information that confirms their existing beliefs and to undervalue information that contradicts their beliefs. With the appropriate research methods, the confirmation bias can be recognized and avoided in UX design. 
   
- Confirmation bias is a cognitive error that occurs when people pursue or analyze information in a way that directly conforms with their existing beliefs or preconceptions. 
   
- Confirmation bias will lead people to discard information that contradicts their existing beliefs, even if the information is factual. 
   
- Confirmation bias can be seen as an instance of priming — our prior beliefs influence how we search for new information and distort how we interpret it. 
   
- People tend to ignore information that challenges their existing beliefs. 
   
- People tend to seek information that confirms their existing beliefs. 
   
- People exhibit this bias when they selectively gather or recall information or when they interpret it in a biased manner 
   
- the more invested you are in your assumptions about the design or the users, the stronger the confirmation bias 
   
- Confirmation bias can have serious consequences in UX research and design because it can distort practitioners’ perspectives by excluding alternative options and delegitimizing disagreement 
   
- Recognizing and overcoming confirmation bias will lead to improved decision making, research, and, eventually, better products and user experiences. 
   
- A better, nonleading question is:
  How was the checkout process? Please explain anything that you liked or disliked about the process. 
   
   - Note: Ask nonleading questions
   
- avoids priming the participants and does not cater to designer’s confirmation bias.
