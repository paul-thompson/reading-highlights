- Principles 
   
- Simplicity 
   
- The secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components. 
   
- Clear thinking becomes clear writing; one can’t exist without the other 
   
- what am I trying to say? Surprisingly often they don’t know. Then they must look at what they have written and ask: have I said it? Is it clear to someone encountering the subject for the first time? 
   
- Simplify, simplify. 
   
- Style 
   
- Be yourself 
   
- The Audience 
   
- It’s a fundamental question, and it has a fundamental answer: You are writing for yourself. 
   
- Never say anything in writing that you wouldn’t comfortably say in conversation. 
   
- Words 
   
- Use a dictionary, and use a dictionary of synonyms. Avoid journalese
