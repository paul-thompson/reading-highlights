- Intrinsic typography shifts all this, clearing it away by starting at the code itself to affect the styling. Instead of writing explicit text styles, you define how those styles change in proportion to the text’s area 
   
- Instead of sizing and spacing text for each component at every breakpoint, the text is given instructions to respond to the areas it is placed in 
   
- Typographic superpowers beyond clamp() 
   
- Intrinsic typographic styling blends the component portability of element queries with the interpolation control of CSS animations, enabling seamless changes of any value across container widths 
   
- How is this different from responsive typography? 
   
- Responsive typography references the viewport to transform text. It does this through media queries, clamp(), or CSS Locks. 
   
- with element queries it’s possible to bind all of the scaling information to a component, where media queries the styles always reference the viewport. 
   
- The anatomy of an intrinsic style 
   
- Typeset intrinsically 
   
- Intrinsic styles are stored in CSS keyframes and change based on the width of a parent element. This enables interpolation of any animatable property across element widths. To reference back to our element queries example, think interpolated element queries. 
   
- Intrinsic Typography is the future of styling on the web 
   
- Intrinsic web design, coined by Jen Simmons, is a concept where common design mutations are baked into the very fabric of our components
