- Refactoring is "a change made to the internal structure of software to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its observable behavior" according to Martin Fowler. 
   
- Clearly everything should work the same way afterwards. 
   
- Don't dedicate time 
   
- dedicated time for some code restructuring will often sound like a joke. Unless it's a side project on your own, good luck in convincing your manager. 
   
- ou don't have to convince anyone, if refactoring is just a part of your daily routine. Like using terminal, commiting in git, reading emails, etc 
   
- Use the proper technique 
   
- basically two components shape the controlled refactoring: small transformations and fast testing, performed after each of those changes. 
   
- Small step-by-step transformations help a lot with preventing a broken state 
   
- Remember the scope 
   
- Did my code become good enough to start with the actual implementation? 
   
- Refactoring definitely worth itself and increases both quality and speed of development 
   
- Restructure your code with the future in mind, but mainly focus on the present. Consider edge cases, but don't try to cover unrealistic ones 
   
- Follow paradigms, but prefer readability. Keep your own coding style, but don't let it lead you. 
   
- When it's better not to refactor 
   
- consider the rule of thumb, that refactoring of a working code without aiming to utilize it is probably a waste of time 
   
- How to refactor without overtime and missed deadlines? Seamless integration into the daily working routine, healthy amount of discipline, pragmatic level of quality were the answers on my way so far.
