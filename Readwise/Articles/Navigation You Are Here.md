- Summary: You-are-here navigation consists of signs that help orient website visitors as they explore the site. Many websites need stronger location indicators. 
   
- Visitors Don’t Always Use the Front Door 
   
- In a world where search engines can drop your website visitors anywhere, it's important to signal where users are in the information space, so they can navigate from there successfully 
   
- Make it easy for visitors to identify both the website and the page topic at a glance. 
   
- On the web, you-are-here signaling is often accomplished by changing the appearance of the navbar, icons, or menus. This navigation signaling is reinforced by breadcrumbs and headings 
   
- Typical You-Are-Here Mechanisms 
   
- Logo and branding: Presenting a logo shows ownership of content. 
   
- Navigation change: A link or graphic element (tab, button, label, etc.) related to navigation becomes more visually prominent when the user selects that topic 
   
- Headings: Left-aligned headings help left-to-right–language readers scan quickly for meaningful words 
   
- Window (page) title: HTML titles appear at the top of each window or tab, in search-engine results, RSS feeds, news aggregators, bookmarks, and history lists 
   
- URL: Well-chosen, human-readable web addresses are important to sharing, credibility, recognition, and recall. 
   
- Breadcrumbs: The information hierarchy is exposed in a linked path. As with URLs, breadcrumb structure can help expose nearby content, but in a more explorable way. 
   
- Contextual cues: Date, tags, icons, and other symbols and signs may be used to place the information in the right context, both in time and in the site’s information architecture. 
   
- Visual design changes: Color-coding, changes in branding, and other visible differences can signal a change of location 
   
- For example, magazines, news sites, and many organizations use color and brand changes to differentiate among features, departments, and product families. 
   
- Steps: Checkout steps, or other sequential task flows, are typically named and numbered on progress indicators 
   
- Page titles and URLs are also helpful for showing information context and location: 
   
- When to Test 
   
- Existing websites can test location signaling anytime. 
   
- For new web designs, testing for location orientation is best done when your website visual design is in the high-fidelity stage
