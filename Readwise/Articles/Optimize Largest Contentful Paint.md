- One factor contributing to a poor user experience is how long it takes a user to see any content rendered to the screen 
   
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) is a Core Web Vitals metric and measures when the largest content element in the viewport becomes visible. 
   
- The most common causes of a poor LCP are 
   
- Slow server response times 
   
- A faster server response time directly improves every single page-load metric, including LCP 
   
- Use Time to First Byte (TTFB) to measure your server response times. You can improve your TTFB in a number of different ways 
   
- Optimize your server
  Route users to a nearby CDN
  Cache assets
  Serve HTML pages cache-first
  Establish third-party connections early
  Use signed exchanges 
   
- Optimize your server 
   
- Analyzing and improving the efficiency of your server-side code will directly improve the time it takes for the browser to receive the data. 
   
- Route users to a nearby CDN 
   
- A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of servers distributed in many different locations 
   
- Consider using a CDN to ensure that your users never have to wait for network requests to faraway servers. 
   
- Cache assets 
   
- your HTML is static and doesn't need to change on every request, caching can prevent it from being recreated unnecessarily 
   
- Serve HTML pages cache-first 
   
- When installed, a service worker runs in the browser background and can intercept requests from the server 
   
- Establish third-party connections early 
   
- Use rel="preconnect" to inform the browser that your page intends to establish a connection as soon as possible. 
   
- You can also use dns-prefetch to resolve DNS lookups faster. 
   
- Although both hints work differently, consider using dns-prefetch as a fallback for browsers that do not support preconnect. 
   
- <head>
  â€¦
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://example.com" />
  <link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://example.com" />
  </head> 
   
- Use signed exchanges (SXGs) 
   
- Signed exchanges (SXGs) are a delivery mechanism that allow for faster user experiences by providing content in an easily cacheable format 
   
- Render blocking JavaScript and CSS 
   
- The HTML parser will pause if it encounters any external stylesheets (<link rel="stylesheet">) or synchronous JavaScript tags (<script src="main.js">). 
   
- The HTML parser will pause if it encounters any external stylesheets 
   
- Scripts and stylesheets are both render blocking resources which delay FCP, and consequently LCP 
   
- Defer any non-critical JavaScript and CSS to speed up loading of the main content of your web page. 
   
- Reduce CSS blocking time 
   
- Ensure that only the minimal amount of necessary CSS is blocking render on your site 
   
- Minify CSS
  Defer non-critical CSS
  Inline critical CSS 
   
- Minify CSS 
   
- For easier legibility, CSS files can contain characters such as spacing, indentation, or comments 
   
- Defer non-critical CSS 
   
- Remove any unused CSS entirely or move it to another stylesheet if used on a separate page of your site. 
   
- use loadCSS to load files asynchronously, which leverages rel="preload"and onload. 
   
- html <link rel="preload" href="stylesheet.css" as="style" onload="this.rel='stylesheet'"> 
   
- Inline critical CSS 
   
- Inline any critical-path CSS used for above-the-fold content by including it directly in <head> 
   
- Inlining important styles eliminates the need to make a round-trip request to fetch critical CSS. Deferring the rest minimizes CSS blocking time. 
   
- Reduce JavaScript blocking time 
   
- Reducing the amount of blocking JavaScript results in a faster render, and consequently a better LCP. 
   
- Slow resource load times 
   
- the time it takes to load many other types of resources can also affect paint times. The types of elements that affect LCP are 
   
- <img> elements
  <image> elements inside an <svg> element
  <video> elements (the poster image is used to measure LCP)
  An element with a background image loaded via the url() function (as opposed to a CSS gradient)
  Block-level elements containing text nodes or other inline-level text elements 
   
- There are a few ways to ensure these files are loaded as fast as possible 
   
- Optimize and compress images 
   
- Preload important resources 
   
- Compress text files 
   
- Deliver different assets based on network connection (adaptive serving) 
   
- Cache assets using a service worker 
   
- Optimize and compress images 
   
- images are the largest element in view when the page has finished loading. 
   
- Hero images, large carousels or banner images are all common examples of this. 
   
- Improving how long it takes to load and render these types of images will directly speed up LCP 
   
- Consider not using an image in the first place. If it's not relevant to the content, remove it. 
   
- Compress images (with Imagemin for example) 
   
- Convert images into newer formats (JPEG 2000, JPEG XR, or WebP) 
   
- Use responsive images 
   
- Consider using an image CDN 
   
- Preload important resources 
   
- If you know that a particular resource should be prioritized, use <link rel="preload"> to fetch it sooner. 
   
- you should first focus on preloading critical assets, such as fonts, above-the-fold images or videos, and critical-path CSS or JavaScript. 
   
- Since Chrome 73, preloading can be used along with responsive images to combine both patterns for much faster image loading. 
   
- Compress text files 
   
- Compression algorithms, like Gzip and Brotli, can significantly reduce the size of text files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) as they're transferred between the server and browser. 
   
- Compressing your resources will minimize their delivery size, improving load times and consequently LCP 
   
- Adaptive serving 
   
- When loading resources that make up the main content of a page, it can be effective to conditionally fetch different assets depending on the user's device or network conditions
