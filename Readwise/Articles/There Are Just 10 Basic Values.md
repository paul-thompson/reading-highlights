- values are “broad, trans-situational, desirable goals that serve as guiding principles in people’s lives.” Basically, they’re the core of who you want to be as a person and reflect what you consider to be important, worthy, and desirable.[1](https://chrisbailey.com/there-are-just-10-basic-values/#fn1-13714) 
   
- Each of us also has an internal hierarchy of values, where we rank our values based on those we find extremely important to those that don’t really motivate us at all. 
   
- **at a fundamental level there are really only 10 basic human values**. Perhaps the most reliable theory of values was developed by Shalom Schwartz 
   
- **Self-direction**: Independent thought and action: choosing, creating, and exploring 
   
- **Stimulation**: Excitement, novelty, and challenge in life 
   
- **Hedonism**: Pleasure and sensuous gratification for oneself 
   
- **Achievement:** Personal success through demonstrating competence according to social standards 
   
- **Power:** Social status and prestige, control or dominance over people and resources 
   
- **Security:** Safety, harmony and stability of society, relationships, and self 
   
- **Conformity:** The restraint of actions, inclinations, and impulses that are likely to upset or harm others and violate social expectations or norms 
   
- **Tradition:** Respect, commitment, and acceptance of the customs and ideas that traditional culture or religion provides 
   
- **Benevolence:** Preservation and enhancement of the welfare of people with whom one is in frequent personal contact 
   
- **Universalism**: Understanding, appreciation, tolerance, and protection for the welfare of all people and of nature 
   
- There are other values nested under each umbrella. Here are some examples of these sub- 
   
- **Self-direction:** Freedom, creativity, independence, choosing your own goals, curiosity 
   
- **Stimulation**: Exciting life, varied life, daring 
   
- **Achievement**: Ambitious, capable, influential, successful 
   
- **Security**: Social order, national security, family security, reciprocation of favours, cleanliness 
   
- **Tradition:** Respect for tradition, modest, humble, accepting my portion in life, devout 
   
- **Universalism:** Equality, unity with nature, wisdom, world of peace, world of beauty, social justice, broad-minded, protecting the environment 
   
- The values outlined in Schwartz’s theory can be found in children as young as five, and research has found that what we value stays surprisingly consistent over time
