- Affordances 
   
- An affordance is what a user can do with an object based on the user’s capabilities. 
   
- As such, an affordance is not a “property” of an object (like a physical object or a User Interface). Instead, an affordance is defined in the relation between the user and the object 
   
- An affordance is, in essence, an action possibility in the relation between user and an object. 
   
- “When affordances are taken advantage of, the user knows what to do just by looking: no picture, label, or instruction needed.”
  — Don Norman, Grand Old Man of User Experience 
   
- Affordances are Everywhere 
   
- Psychologist James Gibson coined “affordance” in 1977, referring to all action possibilities with an object based on users’ physical capabilities 
   
- Don Norman later (1988) introduced the term to the design community modified the meaning slightly to make it more appropriate for use by designers 
   
- Don Norman defined affordances as perceivable action possibilities
