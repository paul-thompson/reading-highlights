- Did you know that pure black text can cause eye strain? A survey found that “58 percent of adults in the U.S.” have experienced eye strain from working on computers 
   
- Pure black text on white backgrounds can cause eye strain when users read the text over an extended period. White has 100% color brightness, and black has 0% color brightness. Such a disparity in color brightness creates intense light levels that overstimulate the eyes when reading text. 
   
- if we turn on a dim light in a dark room, our eyes adapt to the change easier because our retina isn’t overstimulated by such a sharp increase in contrast. 
   
- A research study found that “black text on a white background overstimulates the OFF ganglion cells while white text on black background overstimulates the ON ganglion cells.” 
   
- This finding means that “white text from a black screen could inhibit myopia, while black text on white background may stimulate myopia.” 
   
- A pure black background kills all light emitting from the screen. This makes eyes work harder and open wider since it needs to absorb more light. 
   
- the white letters can bleed into the black background and cause the text to blur. This effect is known as “halation” and it affects users with astigmatism, which people of all ages could have. 
   
- Pure black isn’t harmful to all users. Low vision users, who are sight impaired but not blind, tend to read text better with pure black text or white text on a black background. 
   
- For normal-sighted users, stick with dark gray over black to prevent eye strain. 
   
- If you’re unsure about your color contrast, you can use a color contrast checker to find an optimal range that works for you. It shows you when your color contrast is too low based on accessibility guidelines. However, it doesn’t indicate when your color contrast is too high. That decision is left for the designer’s careful eye to decide.
