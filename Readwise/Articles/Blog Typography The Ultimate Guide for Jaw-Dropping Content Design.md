- Improving typography is one of the most important things you need to do for your blog. 
   
- Good typography gives pleasure to the readers of your blog. 
   
- Choose your font wisely 
   
- given the research data, the difference in reading speed between serif and sans serif is apparently quite small. Thus, there’s no strong usability guideline in favor of using one or the other 
   
- The psychology of fonts 
   
- Traditional, Respectable, Reliable: Use Serif font 
   
- Modern, Minimalistic, Progressive: Use Sans-serif 
   
- Stable, Masculine, Strong:, Impactful: Use condensed fonts (only in headings) 
   
- Beauty, Elegance, Feminine: Use handwritten or script-based fonts (only in headings) 
   
- Paragraphs 
   
- Mixing up short and long paragraphs is a great way to improve the typography of the content. It tricks your readers to read your content completely 
   
- Don’t write long paragraphs. Longest paragraph on your blog should contain 80 words. 
   
- There should be enough space between the paragraphs. 
   
- Lines
  A typical line should contain 50-70 characters. 
   
- When you maintain a good gap between the two lines, readers find it easy to shift from line to line. It comforts their eyes. I suggest you to keep a line height of 1.7 
   
- Title of the blog post 
   
- The font size of the title should be larger than all the other header tags 
   
- The line height of the title should be lesser than that of the main content. I’ve maintained a line-height of 1.2. 
   
- Body font
