- There always seems to be more to do than time permits 
   
- time management isn’t the only way to manage work. What if you were to manage your energy, not your time? 
   
- The 4 key management principles for performance 
   
- people need to match their energy to a task in order to excel. 
   
- The ultimate measure of our lives is not how much time we spend on the planet, but rather how much energy we invest in the time that we have.” 
   
- For full engagement, we need to draw on physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual energy. 
   
- Since energy capacity diminishes with both overuse and underuse, we should balance energy expenditure with renewal 
   
- We must push beyond our limits in the same way elite athletes do in order to build capacity 
   
- Specific routines for managing energy called ‘positive energy rituals’ are important for engagement and performance. 
   
- Time vs. energy: are you prioritizing the correct resource? 
   
- While time is a finite resource, energy works differently 
   
- Energy is a renewable resource, but only up to a certain point. Scheduling every minute of free time to increase productivity may seem like a good use of time, but it doesn’t account for the need to replenish energy. 
   
- High-energy tasks and multitasking can’t be done productively when your energy is already eaten up by a surplus of things scheduled in your day 
   
- Over time, a lack of energy can cause a dip in productivity, even when there’s more than enough time to get the required tasks done. 
   
- Managing energy instead of time isn’t just a theory. Many highly successful people carefully protect their time so that they have the energy and bandwidth to think creatively and increase their resilience 
   
- How to start managing your energy and not your time 
   
- Start by setting your boundaries 
   
- By setting boundaries for yourself, you simultaneously protect your energy levels and motivate yourself to achieve your goals. 
   
- you can create boundaries for how little or how much you want to accomplish in a specific day, depending on your priorities. 
   
- Include rest and recovery in your plans 
   
- When managing your energy, it’s important to think about downtime and recovery. These shouldn’t be an afterthought 
   
- Time isn’t what matters most when you’re concentrating and focusing on managing your energy. Instead, your energy levels are what matter the most. 
   
- When you give yourself time to rest, you’ll replenish your energy levels and become more productive when you’re back at work. You’ll also improve your well-being and experience more positive emotions if you’re rested. 
   
- Keep in mind that it’s important to add this rest and recovery time directly into your schedule. This is important if you tend to get distracted by work. 
   
- Schedule time for deep and inner work 
   
- scheduling designated time for deep work is important. 
   
- Deep work is an uninterrupted period when you can fully focus on high-impact work. 
   
- Deep work requires a lot of energy, but you can be much more productive when you’re fully focused on what you’re doing. 
   
- Make sure to schedule your deep work at a time when your energy is highest
