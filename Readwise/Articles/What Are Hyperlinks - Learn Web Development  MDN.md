- Hyperlinks, usually called links, are a foundational concept behind the Web. 
   
- Back in 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, the Web's inventor, spoke of the three pillars on which the Web stands 
   
- URL, an address system that keeps track of Web documents 
   
- HTTP, a transfer protocol to find documents when given their URLs 
   
- HTML, a document format allowing for embedded hyperlinks 
   
- The Web's original purpose was to provide an easy way to reach, read, and navigate through text documents. 
   
- Since then, the Web has evolved to provide access to images, videos, and binary data, but these improvements have hardly changed the three pillars. 
   
- Links are the breakthrough that made the Web so useful and successful. 
   
- a link is a text string tied to a URL, and we use links to allow easy jumping from one document to another. 
   
- Internal link 
   
- A link between two webpages, where both webpages belong to the same website, is called an internal link 
   
- External link 
   
- A link from your webpage to someone else's webpage. Without external links, there is no Web, since the Web is a network of webpages. 
   
- Incoming links 
   
- A link from someone else's webpage to your site. It's the opposite of an external link 
   
- When you're building a website, focus on internal links, since those make your site usable 
   
- Find a good balance between having too many links and too few 
   
- Most links tie two webpages together. Anchors tie two sections of one document together. 
   
- Links matter both to users and search engines. Every time search engines crawl a webpage, they index the website by following the links available on the webpage. 
   
- Links influence how readily a search engine will link to your site. The trouble is, it's hard to measure search engines' activities. 
   
- A link's visible text influences which search queries will find a given URL. 
   
- The more incoming links a webpage can boast of, the higher it ranks in search results. 
   
- External links influence the search ranking both of source and target webpages, but it is unclear by how much. 
   
- SEO (search engine optimization) is the study of how to make websites rank highly in search results. Improving a website's use of links is one helpful SEO technique
