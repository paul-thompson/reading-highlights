- three contexts of the concept of use: useful, usable and used 
   
- Useful 
   
- A product which is useful is one that allows a user to accomplish a task or objective. 
   
- it is important that there are a number of potential users that find a product useful. (From a commercial perspective this must be at least enough users to make the product profitable). 
   
- Usable 
   
- Usable refers to the usability of a given product. 
   
- It is more than “useful” it examines the way that the product will be used and whether it enables the user to do so in a pleasurable, simple (or as simple as possible) and effective manner 
   
- Many “useful” products fail to be “usable” 
   
- It should be obvious from a user’s point of view which action is required when they see the door – if it’s not and it requires a sign to explain it; that’s a failure of usability. 
   
- It’s worth noting that usability failures are often less catastrophic to a product than a failure to provide something useful 
   
- Poor usability is often a minor inconvenience (you may mutter about how stupid that door is but you’ll probably do very little to change the door – it’s too much effort for too little reward) rather than a deal breaker. 
   
- That usability was the difference between the iPod becoming “just another MP3 player” and become the world’s top selling and most desirable MP3 player. 
   
- Used 
   
- A product may be both useful and usable and still fail to be used 
   
- The ultimate aim of a design is not to be useful or usable but for users to use that design. Without users a product is a failure and it doesn’t matter how great the design was – it’s still a failure 
   
- A product must be useful if it is to be used. 
   
- A product should be usable to increase the chances of use – the more usable a product is, the more enjoyable it will be and the easier it will be to persuade others to use it. 
   
- neither usability nor usefulness guarantees that a design will be used.
