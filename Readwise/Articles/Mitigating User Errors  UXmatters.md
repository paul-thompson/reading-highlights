- User errors occur when people are unable to interact effectively with your Web site or application. 
   
- mistakes—These errors occur when the mental models of users who are not familiar with the way a particular Web site or application works don’t coincide with its actual functionality 
   
- slips—These are unconscious errors that happen when users accidentally take an action that they did not intend to take. 
   
- Slips generally occur when users are familiar with a site or application and its features, but aren’t being sufficiently attentive 
   
- 1. Follow design standards and conventions. 
   
- unconsciously expect your Web site or application to work similarly to others they have used. 
   
- 2. Keep the user in mind throughout design 
   
- Conducting evaluative UX research methods such as usability testing and expert reviews can enable you to discover common user errors, help you understand why users are making particular errors, and learn about users’ expectations for how they can recover from those errors. 
   
- 3. Clearly communicate what users can do. 
   
- Affordances—the controls and other elements with which users can interact—should convey both the purpose for which users can use them and how they can manipulate them. 
   
- Effectively communicating this information prevents user errors and is essential to the design of usable Web sites and applications. 
   
- 4. Enable users to preview the results of their actions. 
   
- Providing a Preview button gives your users the ability to examine their work, verify that an interaction would have the expected result, and rectify any errors when necessary. 
   
- 5. Ask users to confirm destructive actions. 
   
- before deleting an object, make sure you verify that is the action the user intended to perform. 
   
- 6. Provide a safety net for users and support multilevel undo. 
   
- Providing an undo features reduces users’ stress because, if they make an error in their work, they can restore its previous state, then resume where they left off. 
   
- 7. Provide clear messaging and instructions. 
   
- Sufficient communication with users is imperative to generating the best outcomes for your site or application and its users
