- Agile is incompatible with UX research, design, and scalable development. It always will be. It’s time to create a new operational standard. 
   
- **Flaw #1:** Humans are not machinery. 
   
- **Flaw #2:** Design is not inventory 
   
- **Flaw #3:** Product can’t be defined by what can be accomplished by an arbitrary number of people of arbitrary skill and experience in a two-week sprint. 
   
- • **2001 — Agile**
  • **1995 — Scrum**
  • **1988 — Lean**
  • **1960’s — Toyota Production System (TPS)** 
   
- In the 1990s, practitioners in the technology industry explored ways to apply Lean to digital products. 
   
- Lean frameworks are all about build and release 
   
- Success requires strategy, [research](https://uxdesign.cc/heres-what-to-do-when-user-research-doesn-t-fit-in-a-sprint-2f8b5db7d48c), design, and *genchi genbutsu,* just as The Toyota Way intended 
   
- The Backlog isn’t core to the Scrum practice, it’s an artifact of the collateral damage and detritus of everything jettisoned during the sprint. 
   
- Far from eliminating *muda,* Agile and Scrum create **only waste**. It’s a muddy slop of burnout, tech debt, [design debt](https://uxdesign.cc/design-debt-is-often-a-hidden-killer-of-consistency-heres-how-to-resolve-it-39bf6609f1a7), a ballooning backlog, hard-coded front-end logic, and an ever-present threat of a complete refactoring 
   
- You can’t shoehorn a customer-centered solution into a sprint
