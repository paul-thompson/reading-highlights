- one of the biggest benefits of cold showers. It’s about **mastering your mindset** before you step in; it’s about **cultivating mental resilience** in the face of physical discomfort; and it’s about **taking that resilience with you into your day** with the added physiological benefits of improved blood circulation, metabolism, immune system, and alertness. 
   
- Proponents aside, clinical trials have found that [cold showers led to a 29% reduction in people calling off sick from work](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5025014/); another connected [cold showers to improved cancer survival](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2211456/); and another still found that [cold showers may help relieve symptoms of depression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17993252/). 
   
- Real growth—whether physical, financial, psychological, academic, or material—comes from **adversity**. I mean, growing by lifting weights literally requires *tearing your muscle fibers*. 
   
- the secret to accelerating your personal growth is to increase the number of micro-adversities you overcome 
   
- a cold shower is an *achievement* and it floods your ego with a sense of accomplishment. Why? Because you mastered your mind and overcame adversity, just like we discussed. 
   
- cold showers restore, rather than deplete, your day's willpower reserves 
   
- a huge benefit of cold showers is that they make you more mentally resilient and, therefore, more likely to smash your other goals throughout the day!
