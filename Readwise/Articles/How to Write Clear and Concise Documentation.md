- The Problem with our Documentation 
   
- it tends to end up overly complicated, full of jargon, and unfocused. 
   
- One way to put more thought into our documentation is to simply spend more time on it. 
   
- Before writing anything down, spend 10 minutes doing some planning and determine a baseline and a scope for your documentation 
   
- Set a Baseline 
   
- Perhaps one of the hardest parts of technical writing is identifying the skillsets of your audience. 
   
- A baseline of knowledge is the minimum amount of information required to understand the information you write in any given document. 
   
- write out a bulleted list of all topics that you will assume are known by your audience. 
   
- Place this bulleted list at the top of your page in its own section - perhaps label this section as "Baseline".
