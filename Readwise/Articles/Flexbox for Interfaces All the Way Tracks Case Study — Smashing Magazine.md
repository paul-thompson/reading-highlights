- Navigational components proved to be extremely valuable with flexbox, not only for easing implementation, but also for shortening development sessions 
   
- Flexbox can alleviate the need for HTML hackery and can maintain semantics, as the markup demonstrates 
   
- source order is always important for accessibility 
   
- Inline labels and inputs are another great place to use flexbox 
   
- A suggestion for this pattern is to always set images to max-width: 100% when inline inside a flex parent or to define images with a fixed width and then use media queries to adjust as needed. 
   
- Flexbox is ideal for interface elements, but it also plays well with certain layout patterns
