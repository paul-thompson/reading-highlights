- Users of complex applications are frequently interrupted during their workflows, starting a task only to have to wait an extended period of time before completing it 
   
- Clearly indicate progress completed and time or steps remaining 
   
- Contextualize success-dialog messages with additional details 
   
- Enable user-generated notes and comments within the system 
   
- Provide access to historical content 
   
- Allow lengthy processes to run in the background 
   
- Clearly Indicate Progress Completed and Time or Steps Remaining 
   
- During these relatively long waits, visibility of system status is particularly important 
   
- a busy-state loop animation doesn’t tell users whether it’s worth waiting out the process or they should invest in another task or action during the wait 
   
- To clearly indicate progress to users of complex applications 
   
- Communicate percentage of work done or time remaining for any wait that exceeds 10 seconds 
   
- percent-done or time-remaining estimates cannot be provided, indicate relative progress by providing a list of completed and remaining steps. 
   
- Ensure the progress indicator is highly salient and discoverable. 
   
- Contextualize Success-Dialog Messages with Additional Details 
   
- During long waits, complex-app users are likely to step away from their work to complete different activities or initiate other tasks within the system 
   
- To alleviate returning users’ working-memory load and help them recover context, upon completion of a process, provide details that summarize what happened while users were away. 
   
- Success dialogs (system messages that alert the user that a process has been successfully completed) can supply useful contextual information 
   
- To contextualize success messages for users of complex applications: 
   
- Provide start time, stop time, and total time elapsed for long processes. 
   
- Provide information about what occurred during the process (e.g., new records that were created or steps that were skipped). 
   
- Make use of modals for success dialogs occurring after longs waits (i.e., do not allow them to disappear without explicit user interaction). 
   
- Enable User-Generated Notes and Comments Within the System 
   
- An often overlooked strategy for helping complex-app users remember their previous goals and actions is supplementing working memory with some source of external memory, where users can save and access information needed during their workflow within the system. 
   
- Without the ability to add open-ended notes, users typically resort to creating and maintaining various external documents — such as a series of spreadsheets — to log their actions and thought processes 
   
- To help users of complex applications track their thought processes 
   
- Allow users to leave notes and comments within the system to explain their actions, additions, or queries. 
   
- Allow comments to be open-ended 
   
- Do not force users to go outside of the application to track their thought processes and create sources of external memory. 
   
- Provide Access to Historical Content 
   
- Efficiency is critical for users of complex applications. Even seemingly small interactions, such as requiring users to click into a couple of extra screens in order to access a list or table before selecting and loading a project, compiles into wasted time and effort for frequent users 
   
- To support quick task reentrance after breaks in workflow, provide historical content, such as a list of recently viewed files or pages, as soon as possible after the user logs into the application. 
   
- For example, Azure DevOps provides a list of recently accessed content under the heading Continue where you left off when the user logs into the program. 
   
- In contrast, many applications pin items to a homepage or overview screen without explicitly labeling them as Recent Content or Continue where you left off, making it unclear whether they are frequently o 
   
- To help users quickly reenter previously initiated tasks 
   
- Provide a list of recently accessed pages or items. 
   
- Explicitly label this list of items so users understand that it is recent content 
   
- Make this list accessible as quickly as possible. Do not require users to go to a separate overview screen of pages, items, or projects in order to view the list. 
   
- When relevant, enhance historical content with previews (e.g., when files are ambiguously named or take a long time to load 
   
- Allow Lengthy Processes to Run in the Background 
   
- Frequently, users will prefer to perform another task, view additional information, or reference other content within the application while a process is running. 
   
- Allow users the option to run lengthy processes in the background, so that they can continue their work within the application during the time the process is running. 
   
- It’s worth nothing that, because processes that run in the background are not highly visible to users, the success dialogs that display at the completion of these processes should be highly salient and discoverable. 
   
- Modal success dialogs, which must explicitly be dismissed by users, are appropriate because users are likely not paying attention to or thinking about these processes as they continue their work.
