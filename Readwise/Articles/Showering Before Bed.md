- Body temperature plays an important role in the sleep-wake cycle, and human bodies naturally experience a decrease in core body temperature before nightly sleep. 
   
- When incorporated into a bedtime routine, a nighttime shower may help send your brain the signal that it is [time to sleep](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works). 
   
- Effects of Hot Showers on Sleep 
   
- A growing body of research suggests that taking a hot shower or bath before bed can improve sleep. 
   
- Scientists hypothesize that immersing the body in warm water aids this natural temperature regulation process, improving sleep as a result. Researchers have dubbed this phenomenon the “warm bath effect.” 
   
- Those who bathe or shower one to two hours before bedtime also fall asleep faster. The researchers theorize that warm water stimulates blood flow to the hands and feet, which allows body heat to escape more quickly. 
   
- recent study of older adults also found that taking a hot bath one to three hours before bedtime helped them fall asleep faster . 
   
- In a study of older adults, a bath between about 104.5 and 106 degrees Fahrenheit lowered blood pressure before and during sleep, especially when taken less than an hour before bedtime. 
   
- Cold showers might not improve sleep because of cold water’s stimulating properties. Cold water immersion raises levels of cortisol and norepinephrine 
   
- One study found that incorporating even just one minute of cold water into the end of a shower routine reduces the number of sick days a person takes by around one-third during flu season. 
   
- More research demonstrates that warm or hot showers in the evening improve sleep. However, athletes may find that cold showers help reduce muscle stiffness, which may contribute to better sleep by reducing discomfort. 
   
- If you are going to take a shower at night to promote sleep, you might want to consider taking a warm shower instead of one that is steaming hot. Research shows that hot water may cause more dramatic changes to blood pressure in older adults 
   
- Most evidence seems to indicate that taking a shower one to two hours before bedtime gives the body enough time to reach the right temperature for sleep.
