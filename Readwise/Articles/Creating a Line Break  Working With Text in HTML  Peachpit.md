- Creating a Line Break 
   
- Browsers automatically wrap text according to the width of the block or window that contains content 
   
- Using br is a last resort tactic because it mixes presentation with your HTML instead of leaving all display control to your CSS. 
   
- br element is suitable for creating line breaks in poems, in a street address 
   
- Remember that the returns in your code are always ignored, so both paragraphs shown display the same way 
   
- To insert a line break 
   
- Type <br /> (or <br>) where the line break should occur. There is no separate end br tag because it’s what’s known as an empty (or void) element; it lacks content. 
   
- Typing br as either <br /> or <br> is perfectly valid in HTML5.
