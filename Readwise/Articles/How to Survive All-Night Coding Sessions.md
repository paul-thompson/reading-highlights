- Work anywhere 
   
- if you're tired, work in bed or on the couch. While these conditions may not be ideal, they will help you get the job done. 
   
- Toss the schedule 
   
- I don't advocate for long hours, all the time (despite the fact that I often do work them myself). But there are times when they're unavoidable 
   
- I recommend you ditch the clock, put your head down, and tend to whatever task is required in order to get the job done. You can come up for air later. 
   
- Limit distractions/breaks 
   
- It's easy to fall asleep during breaks 
   
- Don't let yourself get too distracted; especially when you're working late. 
   
- Stay focused. Stay on task. And keep your eye on the prize. 
   
- If you do need a break, limit it to something that includes some type of physical activity, like walking. In fact, that's the best type of break when you pull an all-nighter; it helps to keep your mind sharp. 
   
- Stay hydrated 
   
- Drink plenty of water. I can't stress the importance of keeping yourself hydrated 
   
- Nobody's perfect 
   
- The key here is that things don't need to be perfect. They need to work; they need to look good; and they need to do what they're expected to do, but they don't need to be perfect. 
   
- If your code is working – but it could be better – leave it for now, and come back to it later when things aren't so tight
