- When we engage with the world, our brains are constantly organizing the information we encounter into cognitive representations, which are called mental models 
   
- Understanding your users’ mental models will help you make design choices that will be intuitive and engaging for them. 
   
- What is a mental model? 
   
- Jakob Nielsen from the Nielsen Norman Group. He defines mental models as, “what the user believes about the system at hand 
   
- By referring to what they already know from their past interactions with another weather app, for example, the user can streamline their interactions with a new weather app. 
   
- As long as the new app more or less matches the interaction patterns and information architecture of a familiar app, the user will quickly become comfortable with the new weather app. 
   
- What’s included in users’ mental models (and what’s not) 
   
- If you don’t adhere to user’s existing mental models, there will be a mismatch between the user’s idea of how a product will work and the way it actually works. This mismatch can cause all sorts of problems because it will lead to user frustration 
   
- we can make the assumption that many users will expect and understand certain UX conventions, such as: 
   
- Links will be underlined or be written in a different color text
  Buttons will appear in a colored box
  Search boxes will appear in the upper right hand corner of a website
  Logos will appear in the upper left hand corner of a website
  Site-wide navigation will appear at the top or left-hand side of a website. 
   
- Use mental models to create UX that makes sense 
   
- It’s important to remember that each individual’s mental models are subjective. 
   
- new UX solutions should be introduced sparingly. More often than not, UX designers should conform to users’ existing mental models to ensure their expectations are met and their experiences with your latest design are as smooth as possible.
