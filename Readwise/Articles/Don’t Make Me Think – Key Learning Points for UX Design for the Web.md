- Don’t Make Me Think was written by Steve Krug to help people think like usability experts do 
   
- Rocket Surgery Made Easy is a practical guide to usability testing that can be used by just about anyone to examine their web site, software or app to see that their products are as usable as possible. 
   
- Key Ideas from Don’t Make Me Think 
   
- Usability Is… 
   
- Usability is simply the idea that a normal person should be able to use your products without finding the process frustrating or annoying. 
   
- Self Explanatory is the Way Forward 
   
- Don’t Make Me (or Anyone) Think 
   
- Whenever a user opens an app or a web page they should be able to tell you at a glance what it’s for 
   
- Users don’t want to treat your site or app like some sort of cryptic crossword – they want to know what they should do immediately and then do it 
   
- Time Wasting Sucks 
   
- People go online to save time not to spend it. If you waste people’s time they move on. 
   
- Let Me Go Back 
   
- As long as the back button works, mistakes don’t matter too much from a user’s perspective. The back button is the most used feature on the internet today. 
   
- People are Habitual 
   
- If something works well – people will tend to stick to using that 
   
- if you make things usable; you make them sticky. 
   
- Get to the Point 
   
- people don’t look for pleasantries on the internet; they want to get to the point 
   
- Some People Love Search 
   
- You need to have a search facility within your web app or site. 
   
- When you mess with the site map – you mess with their ability to recall these steps and make things confusing for returning users. 
   
- Show Them the Way to Go Home 
   
- The home button is the ultimate emergency exit for users. If they get really, really lost and even the back button isn’t helping – they need a single click to get them home. 
   
- The Take Away 
   
- Don’t Make Me Think is all about simple ideas and simple ways to put them into practice
