- learning new things is hard 
   
- Jargon! Syntax! Tools! It’s easy to feel overwhelmed, especially if you’re just getting started 
   
- How We Learn 
   
- First, you start out in the developing stage. You’re still acquiring knowledge - maybe you’ve done a few tutorials. But you don’t have a lot of practice under your belt yet, and so you still need a lot of support to do anything substantial. 
   
- Once you’ve practiced some more, you move on to the competence stage. This is when you start to “get” it. You can do the thing, but it still requires conscious effort, or extra supports like checklists or cheat sheets. 
   
- If you practice even more, eventually you reach the mastery stage. This is when you’ve developed deep expertise in a subject. At this point, you understand how nearly all the pieces of the puzzle fit together, and you can do the thing without consciously thinking about it. 
   
- Tangent: Why Competence Isn't Enough 
   
- once you can handle the basics on autopilot, your brain is freed up to spend more time doing the hard work of creative problem solving. 
   
- Tips to Maximize Learning 
   
- The main strategies I’m going to talk about in this post are a combination of retrieval practice and feedback-driven metacognition 
   
- Basically, trying to remember things that you’ve learned, and then checking your answers to see if you were right. 
   
- 1) Retrieval Practice 
   
- “The limiting factor for long-term memory is not retention (what is stored) but recall (what can be accessed).” 
   
- Retrieval practice, on the other hand, is all about trying to get information out of your brain. Which is ultimately the skill you want to practice 
   
- Your brain has two different kinds of memory: working memory (also called short-term memory) and long-term memory. 
   
- Retrieval practice is the act of deliberately pulling information out of your long-term memory and back into your working memory 
   
- When you practice remembering a particular piece of information, your brain thinks, “Oh, we keep trying to access this memory, so it must be important,” and strengthens those neural pathways, which makes it easier for you to remember that thing again next time. 
   
- Studies have shown that using retrieval practice leads to better long-term retention of information than cramming or rereading
