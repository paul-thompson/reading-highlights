- event delegation has several benefits in comparison to attaching individual event listeners to a long a list of items. 
   
- Memory: More event listeners means more memory consumption as the browser has to listen to more events. 
   
- Code maintainability: Event delegation improves code maintainability because events from multiple elements can be handled all in one place in contrary to handling them individually. 
   
- it is proven that delegated event listener is more performant and should be used when listening to events from a large list of items.
