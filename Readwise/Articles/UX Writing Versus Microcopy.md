- there’s a lot of misunderstanding about what a UX Writer is, and what it isn’t. 
   
- UX writing is about much, much more than just microcopy 
   
- UX writing is narrower, focusing on product writing for the end-to-end user journey. 
   
- Microcopy just defines a category of UI text that falls solidly within UX writing. Calling all UX writing “microcopy writing” is just—wrong. 
   
- UX writing is much broader than that. It describes the customer-facing communication at every point in a long customer journey, not just the bits of UI text that accompany components. 
   
- UX writers are interaction designers for product content 
   
- Content creation 
   
- …aka writing. Most UX content strategists are also writers. All UX writers write microcopy. Not all microcopy or UI writers can say they’re UX writers because they might not be looking at the whole experience. 
   
- Praising microcopy alone minimizes the work that goes into the rest of the process: voice development, narrative arc creation, interaction design and task flows, info hierarchy, error prevention, concise guidance and nearly invisible but encouraging instruction and context at every single step in the user journey. 
   
- Your job is to understand the user’s mental model, their current basis for understanding, and shift them to understand what it is you’re offering. 
   
- Now that you understand the problem and the context, writing microcopy comes within a fuller context that will take the scope of the users’ needs into account. Writing messages at the beginning of this journey would negate all the discovery you’ve done.
