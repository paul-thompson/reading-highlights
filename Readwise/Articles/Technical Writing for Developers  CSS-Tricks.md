- as we aim to write more and better code, the way we write and communicate in everyday language becomes more and more important… and perhaps even overlooked 
   
- The way we write about and around code is arguably as important as the code itself 
   
- Technical writing is everywhere 
   
- Words are written language. And if we wrote our words better, we’d communicate better. When we communicate better, we’re more likely to get what we want. 
   
- What is good grammar? 
   
- It’s not unusual to accidentally write messages that come across as condescending, offensive, and unprofessional. This is where tone comes into play 
   
- Your voice is akin to who you are as a person, whereas tone is how you respond in a given situation. 
   
- Active and passive voice 
   
- The actor comes first in an active voice 
   
- Sentences that use an active voice are more straightforward than their counterparts 
   
- With a passive voice, the actor comes last. 
   
- “The background is painted by CSS.” 
   
- Readers usually convert a passive voice to an active voice in their heads, resulting in more processing time 
   
- Tech writers prefer the active voice most of the time, with very few exceptions such as citing research: “It has been suggested that …” 
   
- Avoiding mistakes 
   
- Grammar is all about the structure and correctness of language, and there’s nothing better to achieve that than a quick proofreading of your document. 
   
- Remember that the purpose of a comment is to add value to a piece of code, not to repeat it. 
   
- Comments should reflect the current code 
   
- confusion fiasco was caused by a stale comment 
   
- change your comments the same time you change the code. 
   
- Comments should explain unidiomatic code 
   
- Writing pull requests 
   
- Pull requests (PRs) are a fundamental aspect of any project. 
   
- A good PR description summarizes what change is being made and why it’s being made. Large projects have a pull request template 
   
- Avoid vague PR titles 
   
- PR titles are traditionally written in imperative tense. They’re a one-line summary of the entire PR, and they should describe what is being done by the PR 
   
- Avoid long PRs 
   
- A large PR means a huge description, and no one wants to review hundreds or thousands of lines of code, sometimes just to end-up dismissing the whole thing 
   
- communicate with your team through Issues,
  make a plan,
  break down the problem into smaller pieces, or
  work on each piece separately with its own PR 
   
- Provide details in the PR body 
   
- Unlike the PR title, the body is the place for all the details, including 
   
- Why is the PR being done?
  Why is this the best approach?
  Any shortcomings to the approach, and ideas to solve them if possible
  The bug or ticket number, benchmark results, etc 
   
- Reporting bugs 
   
- ### Steps to reproduce
  Tell us how to reproduce this issue.
  ### Expected behavior
  Tell us what should happen.
  ### Actual behavior
  Tell us what happens instead. 
   
- Gather screenshots 
   
- You may need to capture an actual interaction to demonstrate the issue. If that’s the case, try to record GIFs using a screen-recording tool. 
   
- Communicating with clients 
   
- Ask clients what they want, and always listen to their feedback
