- Measuring programming progress is extremely hard to do. It doesn’t come naturally to humans to measure progress of a mental skill. Programming is a very mental skill 
   
- Make it Visible 
   
- Physical progress feels so rewarding because it is visible. So make your progress learning programming visible as well. 
   
- One of the best ways to do this is via todo lists. I would recommend using Trello 
   
- Create a Board 
   
- Create a new board and call it ‘Programming Progress’. Then create three lists; ‘Want to Learn’, ‘Learning’ and ‘Learned’ 
   
- Topic Cards 
   
- Now add a card for each language or library you want to learn. That could be ‘Python’ or ‘React’ or ‘WordPress Development’ or even ‘Algorithms 
   
- Focus on the topics you need now, you can always add more later. 
   
- Checklist of Learning 
   
- go find a good tutorial on that Topic 
   
- Go to the table of contents for that tutorial. Make a new checklist in your Topic card and add an item for every section of the tutorial. 
   
- We now have a progress tracker! As you complete the sections on the tutorial, check them off the list and the progress meter will advance. 
   
- Learning programming is hard, but keeping your motivation up by making your progress visual will certainly help you along the way.
