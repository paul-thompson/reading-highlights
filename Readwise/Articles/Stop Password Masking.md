- Summary: Usability suffers when users type in passwords and the only feedback they get is a row of bullets. 
   
- Providing feedback and visualizing the system's status have always been among the most basic usability principles 
   
- More importantly, there's usually nobody looking over your shoulder when you log in to a website. It's just you, sitting all alone in your office, suffering reduced usability to protect against a non-issue. 
   
- The Costs of Masking 
   
- Password masking has proven to be a particularly nasty usability problem in our testing of mobile devices, where typing is difficult and typos are common 
   
- When you make it hard for users to enter passwords you create two problems 
   
- Users make more errors when they can't see what they're typing while filling in a form. They therefore feel less confident. 
   
- The more uncertain users feel about typing passwords, the more likely they are to (a) employ overly simple passwords and/or (b) copy-paste passwords from a file on their computer. Both behaviors lead to a true loss of security. 
   
- In cases where there's a tension between security and usability, sometimes security should win. 
   
- Abandon Legacy Design 
   
- Password masking has become common for no reasons other than (a) it's easy to do, and (b) it was the default in the Web's early days. 
   
- Generally, I recommend adhering to conventions. Do what users expect, and they can concentrate their brainpower on understanding your products and offers instead of struggling with the user interface. 
   
- Let's clean up the Web's cobwebs and remove stuff that's there only because it's always been there. 
   
- Update: Microsoft Listens 
   
- The release of Internet Explorer 10 in 2013 added a neat new feature: view password in cleartext while clicking a small icon in a field with otherwise-masked characters
