- the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) score measures the perceived loading speed of a website 
   
- What is the Largest Contentful Paint? 
   
- The Largest Contentful Paint refers to the biggest visual part of the page. 
   
- Primarily, LCP only considers the objects that are located above the page fold, which is the content visible to the user without scrolling 
   
- LCP is more closely correlated to the user experience, and a fast LCP usually minimizes user irritation. 
   
- Why does Largest Contentful Paint matter for SEO? 
   
- the Google search engine algorithm considers LCP a significant ranking signal for measuring page experience 
   
- The faster the site loads, the better will be its ranking on the Google search results page. 
   
- Google considers a website’s perceived load time of less than 2.5 seconds to be “good”. 
   
- The primary function of a content delivery network (CDN) is quick content delivery to your target users through an extensive network of servers managed by a CDN provider. CDNs can also help with load balancing and image compression. 
   
- Enable Caching Your Website 
   
- Cache your content (images, text, and more) to lower the page load time and the site’s TTFB, so it doesn’t have to reload every time 
   
- Browser caching will deliver the largest contentful paint faster than the regular roundtrip to a local CDN. 
   
- Establish Third-Party Connections Early 
   
- You can also use Prefetch DNS for various other external assets Google Analytics, Google fonts, and even a CDN 
   
- You can eliminate roundtrips latency from the request path by even thousands of milliseconds – saving render-blocking time for users by increasing load speed. 
   
- . Render-blocking CSS and JavaScript 
   
- A browser needs only the essential elements required to construct a page before rendering it for viewers to see 
   
- You can improve your LCP score by delaying the JS and CSS files loading 
   
- Minify your CSS
  Defer non-critical CSS
  Defer Inline critical CSS
  Minify and compress JS files
  Defer unused JS elements
  Eliminate unused polyfills 
   
- Slow-loading resources 
   
- Images usually count for most of the loading delays, affecting the LCP score. 
   
- Compress large images before uploading them to your site
  Use a plugin to compress the images once uploaded to your site
  Serve graphic content in WebP format instead of PNG or JPEG
  Preferably use high-quality and responsive images in correct sizes 
   
- Native Lazy Loading 
   
- Moreover, the resources like SVG, videos, and images can badly affect the LCP when rendered above the first fold (before scrolling). 
   
- How to fix it? 
   
- Compress and minify critical JS files to reduce the JS blocking time.
  Use server-side rendering instead of client-side rendering where possible.
  Consider using Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) to eliminate animations and heavy elements, improving the load times.
  Preload essential resources (refer to the earlier section in this article).
  Prioritize browser service workers for caching assets (background process responsible for caching).
