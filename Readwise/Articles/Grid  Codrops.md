- CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system created specifically to tackle grid-based user interfaces on the web. 
   
- Grid also comes with a powerful auto-placement algorithm, which makes it easier to fill up available space without having to do a lot of complicated calculations 
   
- Grid even allows some flexibility on the z-axis, in that you can overlap grid items if you need to.
