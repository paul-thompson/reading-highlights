- HTML documents are basically a tree of nodes, including HTML elements and text nodes 
   
- HTML elements provide the semantics and formatting for documents, including creating paragraphs, lists and tables, and embedding images and form controls. 
   
- Elements 
   
- HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear or act in a certain way. 
   
- Elements and tags aren't the exact same thing, though many people use the terms interchangeably 
   
- When nesting elements, it's important that they are properly nested. 
   
- There are two types of elements: replaced and non-replaced. 
   
- Non-replaced elements 
   
- The paragraph, header, and lists marked up in the earlier section are all non-replaced. Non-replaced elements have opening and (sometimes optional) closing tags that surround them and may include text and other tags as sub-elements. 
   
- Replaced and void elements 
   
- Replaced elements are replaced by objects, be it a graphical user interface (UI) widget in the case of most form controls, or a raster or scalable image file in the case of most images. 
   
- Replaced elements and void elements are often confused. Void elements are all self-closing elements and are represented by one tag 
   
- Most replaced elements are void elements, but not all. The video, picture, object, and iframe elements are replaced, but aren't void 
   
- Why have a void element, which can't have any content, that isn't replaced and thereby doesn't render anything to the screen? To provide information about the content! The information is provided by the elements' attributes. 
   
- Attributes 
   
- Attributes are what make HTML so incredibly powerful. We'll be covering hundreds of attributes and attribute values in this series, but here we'll just discuss what they are in general and how to include them.
