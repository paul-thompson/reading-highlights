- there are quite a few reasons why so many programmers prefer to work during the odd hours 
   
- The maker's schedule 
   
- According to Paul Graham, people who "produce stuff" tend to adhere to the maker's scheduleâ€”they prefer to use time in units of a half-day or longer. 
   
- most developers have the same preference. 
   
- Having their schedules sliced into 15- or 30-minute chunks for emails, meetings, phone calls, and interruptions from co-workers is simply counterproductive. 
   
- Programming is also adversely affected by context-switching. By working at night, developers can avoid as many distractions
