- he transfer of the requested data on the local computer takes place thanks to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP. The browser (referred to as ‘client’ in this case) requests that the web server answers with an HTTP status code comprising of three numbers. 
   
- The web server then informs the browser whether the request was successful, whether there was an error or whether authentication is required. 
   
- HTTP status codes are generally divided into five different classes. 
   
- Class 1xx – Informational 
   
- the server informs the client that the request is in motion. This class combines codes that are responsible for delivering information to the client during the request. 
   
- Class 2xx – Success 
   
- t means that the client’s request was received by the server, understood, and accepted. 2xx codes are often sent at the same time as the desired website information, and the user often only takes notice of the website they have requested. 
   
- Class 3xx – Redirection 
   
- A 2xx code announces a successful operation 
   
- In order to ensure the request is successfully processed, further steps are needed from the client’s end. 3xx codes appear during redirections and forwards. 
   
- Class 4xx – Client error 
   
- there’s been a client error 
   
- The server has received the request, but cannot perform it. The reason behind this is usually an incorrect request. Internet users will be made aware of this error by receiving an automatically generated HTML page. 
   
- Class 5xx – Server error 
   
- he server has failed to perform the request. These server error codes report that the request cannot be performed at present or is not possible at all 
   
- Important HTTP status codes at a glance 
   
- Status code 200 – OK 
   
- The HTTP status code 200 shows that the request was successfully carried out 
   
- Status code 301 – Moved Permanently 
   
- Since the current location of the requested content is delivered in the status report, the browser can request the new address straightaway. The user is then forwarded to the new address and the old address is no longer valid. The 301 code also goes unnoticed because the URL in the address bar simply changes. 
   
- Status code 302 – Moved Temporarily 
   
- the 302 informs the user that the requested data has temporarily been moved. With a 302 code the remaining information is specified so that an automatic redirection can take place. The old address remains valid. 
   
- The HTTP status code 403 tells the client that the requested data is access-protected and that the request cannot be performed due to the client not having authority. 
   
- Status code 404 – Not Found 
   
- it means that the requested website information was not found on the server 
   
- Users that receive a 404 message should check whether the address was written correctly in the address bar. Any links to non-existing pages are known as ‘dead links’. 
   
- Status code 500 – Internal Server Error 
   
- The 500 server response functions as a collection status code for unexpected server errors. 
   
- As well as sending an answer to the client the webserver also creates an internal error report. This should be analyzed by the website owner so that repairs can be carried out on the server software. 
   
- a 503 code it means that the relevant web server, which should deliver the requested information, is overloaded. 
   
- What do HTTP status codes mean for search engine optimisation? 
   
- For SEO reasons the 301 code is displayed since link strength maintenance is of great importance. 
   
- If the search engine crawler finds a 301 status code during a web address request, the invalid address will be deleted from the search index and a redirect then takes place. 
   
- The link strength of old pages doesn’t get lost in the process but is transferred to the 301 forwarding destination
