- Overview 
   
- Takeaways 
   
- People will perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form possible, because it is the interpretation that requires the least cognitive effort of us. 
   
- The human eye likes to find simplicity and order in complex shapes because it prevents us from becoming overwhelmed with information. 
   
- Research confirms that people are better able to visually process and remember simple figures than complex figures. 
   
- Origins 
   
- In 1910, psychologist Max Wertheimer had an insight when he observed a series of lights flashing on and off at a railroad crossing. 
   
- To the observer, it appears as if a single light moves around the marquee, traveling from bulb to bulb, when in reality it’s a series of bulbs turning on and off and the lights don’t move it all 
   
- These principles sit at the heart of nearly everything we do graphically as designers
