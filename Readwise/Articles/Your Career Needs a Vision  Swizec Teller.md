- Your career needs a vision. Even a bad one is better than nothing 
   
- No matter how fast you walk, how often you change jobs, you'll never make it farther than the square root of the number of steps â€“ Math.sqrt(n). 
   
- Each step is random, but they're 10% biased towards a vision. You travel a distance proportional to n and go 
   
- But if you add a pinch of vision, a small bias towards your goal, you'll have a great career
