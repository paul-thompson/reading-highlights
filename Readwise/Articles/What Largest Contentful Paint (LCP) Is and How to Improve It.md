- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) is the most important metric for your score in Google’s PageSpeed Insights. 
   
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) measures the time it takes for the largest above the fold content element to load 
   
- Everything below 2.5s is considered good LCP time. 
   
- First, the largest element can be an image, video, or a block of text. 
   
- Second, only above the fold content can affect this metric. 
   
- Finally, LCP can be measured both in the lab and in the field 
   
- Lab data determines your overall PageSpeed optimization score at the top. 
   
- field data shows how real users experience your site. That’s what you should focus on in the long run. 
   
- The Shortcomings of First Contentful Paint (FCP) and First Meaningful Paint (FMP) 
   
- FMP is no longer a part of Google's PageSpeed scores. 
   
- it wasn't as "meaningful" as the name suggested 
   
- FCP measures how long it takes for any content to be painted. Anything described in the Document Object Model (DOM) triggers FCP. 
   
- With LCP, you know how long it takes for the largest element to load 
   
- FCP tracks the beginning of the loading experience while LCP tracks its culmination. By analyzing both, you get a better picture of the actual user experience on your page. 
   
- The largest element often plays the most prominent role. It needs to load fast. Otherwise, many of your website’s visitors won’t stick around. 
   
- How to Reduce LCP Time 
   
- Image optimization. Includes choosing the right image format, compressing images, adding width and height attributes and other techniques. 
   
- CSS and JavaScript optimization. 
   
- Includes compressing and minifying code files, delivering smaller JavaScript payloads and implementing Critical CSS; 
   
- Improving server performance. 
   
- Includes upgrading your hosting plan, optimizing your server, using a CDN, service workers and other techniques; 
   
- Preloading and preconnecting. 
   
- Includes using rel=preload, rel=preconnect and rel=dns-prefetch to point the browser to resources and connections it needs to prioritize; 
   
- Limiting and optimizing client-side rendering. 
   
- Depends on your specific site setup. The important thing is to be aware of how much work you’re putting on the client and how that affects performance.
