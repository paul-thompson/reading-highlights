- Overview 
   
- Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. 
   
- Takeaways 
   
- Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that appears similar. 
   
- By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the users can focus on their tasks rather than on learning new models 
   
- When making changes, minimize discord by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited time. 
   
- Origins 
   
- Jakob’s Law was coined by Jakob Nielsen, a User Advocate and principal of the Nielsen Norman Group which he co-founded with Dr. Donald A. Norman (former VP of research at Apple Computer).
