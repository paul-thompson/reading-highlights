- I'm going to let you in on a secret to the success of professional writers. They hear their writing. Besides the sound of pen on paper or tapping computer keys, they actually hear the words as they go down--their writing is an auditory process. 
   
- Now that you know that, de-stilting your writing is a two-minute process. 
   
- The first is to write down a few sentences and then read them out loud. Does it sound like a conversation? Or is it full of hitchy clauses and Big Impressive Words nobody uses in real life? Those are writing killers and they're to blame for your stilted final product. 
   
- The second road is to talk out loud as you write. Tell your computer or notebook your story and transcribe it as you go. Stop writing the Great American Article (or report or press release or whatever) and just talk. You can use speech-to-text software like Dragon to do this or you can just talk and type. No big words, no need to impress, no hiccupy clauses. Simple conversation 
   
- Writing out loud lets the reader hear your words in your voice. And that's what really good writing does.
