- What is copywriting? 
   
- Copywriting is writing with a job to do. Writing with a practical purpose. Usually, that purpose is to make the reader think, feel or act differently from the way they did before. 
   
- Copywriting is like a bridge. On one side is the person who will read your copy. On the other side is you, along with whatever you’re selling. Your job is to get the reader to cross the bridge and give it a try. 
   
- Wherever words are making things happen for businesses and organisations, that’s copywriting. 
   
- Copywriting can be tough. The search for a simple, powerful idea can be long and frustrating. 
   
- Your reader isn’t eagerly waiting for your copy. In fact, they’d rather not read it at all. You have literally seconds to capture their attention before it jumps to something else. 
   
- ‘People read what interests them, and sometimes it’s an ad.’1 Your job is to hit that sweet spot where your message meets readers’ interest – and turn that interest into action.
