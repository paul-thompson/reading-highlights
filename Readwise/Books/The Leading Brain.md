- Gain the Control You Need to Zero In on What’s Important and Leave Distractions Behind 
   
- what is often perceived as distracted behavior by outsiders is actually an indication of the exact opposite! 
   
- UNDERSTANDING FOCUS 
   
- It is the job of the prefrontal cortex to either boost or attenuate each of these signals. 
   
- FOCUS STARTS WITH THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX 
   
- The PFC is responsible for higher-order thinking like planning and decision making, as well as focus, or what psychologists commonly call attention 
   
- THE RECIPE FOR ATTENTION 
   
- The DNA of Peak Performance—dopamine, noradrenaline, and acetylcholine—not coincidentally, is also the recipe for attention. 
   
- Unfortunately, dopamine and noradrenaline operate like double agents in a spy thriller: They can both strengthen and sabotage your attention. 
   
- One influential study showed that subjects were distracted from the task at hand almost 50 percent of the time. 
   
- The best way to sharpen your focus is to eliminate factors that disrupt it and cultivate skills that encourage it. 
   
- Multitasking is the archenemy of focus. 
   
- multitasking is the archenemy of focus. That’s because, unlike the many disruptive sights, sounds, and smells you often can’t control, multitasking is a voluntary distraction. 
   
- Minimizing Multitasking 
   
- When you think you are multitasking, what you are probably doing is sequential task switching, shifting your focus rapidly back and forth between multiple activities. 
   
- People who are interrupted take an estimated 50 percent longer to complete a task and have been found to make up to 50 percent more errors. 
   
- researchers at the University of California, Irvine, found that it requires an average of twenty-three minutes to get fully back on track, even after a brief interruption. 
   
- Why would you knowingly reduce your efficiency, deliberately increase your odds of making mistakes, and intentionally make yourself less intelligent? Now that you’ve read this, maybe you’ll no longer multitask. 
   
- As Steven Kotler, author of The Rise of Superman, explains, “By trying to improve performance by being everywhere and everywhen, we end up nowhere and never.” 
   
- WE’RE ATTRACTED TO NOVELTY 
   
- Blame your brain. We multitask because our brains are driven by a powerful search for novelty. 
   
- Habitual multitaskers are “suckers for irrelevancy,” explained Clifford Nass, the professor who led the Stanford study. 
   
- do your best to ensure that the most interesting and enjoyable stimulus is the very activity you’re focused on. 
   
- Take time to settle and focus before engaging in a particular activity. 
   
- Emotions can make focusing easier. If your task is novel and fun, you’re less likely to look elsewhere for stimulation. 
   
- Work on one task at your desk and then pick up your laptop and move to a different location before starting the next task. 
   
- Eliminate Potential Distractions at the Outset 
   
- It takes valuable space in your prefrontal cortex to resist potential distractions. Furthermore, it’s stressful. 
   
- Self-discipline may be an admirable trait, but it depletes valuable brainpower at an alarming rate. 
   
- when you need to focus, you are in an important meeting—with yourself. 
   
- Work in Manageable Blocks of Time 
   
- The satisfaction of completing each time block should give you a dose of dopamine, as will the prospect of facing the next “new” task. 
   
- Use Your Brain Wisely 
   
- when it has lyrics—can definitely interfere with functions like reading comprehension and information processing. 
   
- develop a routine of checking e-mails at scheduled times during the day and that you leave your e-mail notification off for the rest of the time. 
   
- the single most tenacious source of distraction, more powerful than sights, sounds, smells, or other external sensations, is your own wandering mind. 
   
- Mind wandering not only occupies roughly half our waking life, but it’s also associated with lower levels of happiness. 
   
- A wandering mind is the domain of neuronal circuitry known as the default mode network, or simply the default network. The default network, 
   
- The more enjoyable the activity, the less likely it is to be accompanied by a wandering mind. 
   
- when we’re happy, our brains release a number of neurochemicals, including dopamine, which greatly increases our ability to learn and remember. 
   
- Mindfulness is the antidote for a wandering mind. 
   
- you learn to become an outside observer of your own thinking process, a skill that gives you greater control over those times when your thoughts are focused and prevents you from constantly heading down the path of each new distraction. 
   
- An alternate, secular definition of mindfulness is “restful awareness”: “awareness” because you’re paying attention and you know you’re paying attention, and “restful” 
   
- Mindfulness has been shown to physically change several regions of the brain in as little as eight weeks. 
   
- Mindfulness thickens your frontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex, which increases not only your capacity for attention but also your memory and processing power. 
   
- Mindfulness actually leads to a decrease in density in at least one area, the amygdala, the region of the brain most associated with emotional reactivity and fear. 
   
- Gain a Sharper Focus 
   
- meditators appear to have greater control over mind wandering even when they aren’t engaged in meditation. 
   
- To strengthen focus you need to increase activity in the prefrontal cortex and the parietal cortex. The PFC is critical for maintaining attention, 
   
- Make Mindfulness a Habit 
   
- Practicing Mindfulness 
   
- you can practice it in a wide variety of situations, such as while you’re eating, walking, showering, going for a run, or simply taking a break at your desk. 
   
- become increasingly adept at focusing on this single sensation at the expense of all others. 
   
- S = Stop T = Take a breath O = Observe P = Proceed 
   
- “metacognitive awareness”—can lead to potent, positive, and often permanent changes in your thinking patterns and physical responses. 
   
- pauses encouraged emotional regulation 
   
- reducing distractions, discouraging multitasking, and encouraging mindfulness in the workplace are putting their employees on the path to the most satisfying and productive form of focus: flow. 
   
- “flow” to describe the supreme and most rewarding form of concentration that is popularly known by a variety of nicknames, including feeling “in the zone,” “in the groove,” and “centered.” 
   
- Productivity increases fivefold when top executives are in flow. 
   
- Achieving Flow 
   
- To achieve flow, you need a well-defined goal, an optimal challenge, and clear, immediate feedback. 
   
- You have to be working toward something specific, and you need to have a strong sense of where your efforts are leading. 
   
- Steven Kotler, “The point is this: when the brain is charged with a clear goal, focus narrows considerably, the unimportant is disregarded, and the now is all that’s left.” 
   
- The divided attention that grows out of attempting to accomplish two or more things at once robs the productivity and satisfaction that come from pursuing a single purpose. 
   
- It’s important to note that your chances of experiencing flow increase in proportion to your abilities. The higher your skill level, the more likely the occurrence of flow. 
   
- Clear, Immediate Feedback 
   
- Using Flow Strategically 
   
- Flow represents the pinnacle of peak performance. It marks the culmination of optimal emotional regulation and a sharpened focus. 
   
- True multitasking, which relies entirely on the PFC, is impossible. Instead, your brain switches rapidly back and forth between tasks, a highly inefficient process that comes at great cost to both concentration and productivity. 
   
- Don’t resist distractions. Get rid of them. 
   
- One simple strategy for sharpened focus is to regularly set aside a block of time when you close your door, silence your devices, and focus exclusively on a few minutes or hours of undistracted thinking time with yourself. 
   
- Mindfulness can change the wiring of your brain to improve your performance and increase your ability to focus. 
   
- the fact is that we spend most of our days engaged in one habit or another. And for the most part that’s a good thing. 
   
- once you manage to sufficiently strengthen and establish a new and rewarding habit, your brain will automatically choose it instead of the old one. 
   
- Our brains may be smart, but they’re also kind of lazy. 
   
- When it comes to habits, all of us are power users. The basal ganglia provide storage for your brain’s equivalent of computer macros. 
   
- A typical habit has three components: a cue, a routine, and a reward. 
   
- The cue is what triggers the routine. The routine is the habit itself. 
   
- Establishing good habits or getting rid of bad ones involves the same basic skills: 1) goal setting and motivation, 2) getting started, and 3) staying on track. 
   
- Most successful goals share two key qualities: 1) there is an emotional basis for the motivation, and 2) the goal setter is able to visualize not only reaching that goal but also, and more important, the process involved in achieving it. 
   
- A goal without emotion is a goal that is almost guaranteed to fail. 
   
- visualizing the path to your goal is more powerful than imagining its completion, 
   
- Getting Started 
   
- Procrastination is the principal impediment to initiating a habit change. 
   
- Kaizen, the practice of using small steps, can help you to avoid the threat response that frequently drives procrastination. 
   
- Using the mantra of “continuous improvement,” the idea was to make modest but steady alterations 
   
- Kaizen’s “small questions” provide a powerful way of programming your brain. 
   
- The principle of “mind sculpture” suggests that the brain learns better in small increments instead of large doses. 
   
- The key is to continue making steady progress. 
   
- Give small rewards. As we now know, most of the habits we engage in were originally triggered by the expectation of some sort of reward. 
   
- If you’ve tried to make a fundamental change in the way things are done at your company, you may have been genuinely surprised by the level of resistance you’ve encountered from some of your colleagues. 
   
- Your well-meaning improvements have bypassed the more reasonable prefrontal cortex of your colleagues and gone straight to the amygdala, the principal region of the notorious fight-or-flight response. 
   
- The secret of kaizen is that it operates below the radar of your brain’s threat response. 
   
- Making new habits stick can be difficult if not impossible if you try to use inhibition and willpower. 
   
- The key to keeping your resolutions is to increase their energy efficiency. You do this by transforming them into habits. 
   
- A resolution without a cue taxes the brain’s limited supply of willpower. 
   
- There are many ways to use implementation intentions to develop individual habit changes in teams. 
   
- “3-D habit change”: describe, distract, and delay. 
   
- Resisting a habit directly is no more effective than inhibition is in attempting to tamp down an unwelcome emotion. 
   
- Cognitive Jujitsu, that is, skillfully using the power of the unconscious by deflecting instead of opposing it, is more likely to lead to a successful outcome. 
   
- The way to outsmart the brain’s natural aversion to change is to use kaizen, which involves taking very small steps. 
   
- Sustainable habits depend on triggers. If you want to make a change that lasts, good intentions aren’t enough. You need to attach your new routine to a trigger. 
   
- unlike the working memory, which typically has room for just four pieces of information at a time, the capacity of the unconscious is practically limitless. 
   
- In fact, it’s next to impossible to make a complex conscious decision using just your working memory; it simply doesn’t have enough room or resources to accommodate all the variables. When your working memory runs out of energy, you experience decision fatigue. 
   
- The brain becomes more focused on short-term rewards and less interested in long-term prospects.2 
   
- Thinking less can lead to a smarter answer. 
   
- “A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention.” 
   
- neuroscience has proved that lifelong learning is entirely possible. This concept is known as neuroplasticity. 
   
- a special protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which helps to consolidate those neurons so they fire together in the future.
