- The JS engine compiles your code right before (and sometimes during!) execution. 
   
- Closure is perhaps the single most important concept in all of JS, 
   
- The module pattern is perhaps the most prevalent code organization pattern in all of JavaScript; deep understanding of it should be one of your highest priorities. 
   
- The this keyword is dynamically bound based on how the function in question is executed, and it turns out there are four simple rules to understand and fully determine this binding. 
   
- while the syntax may trick you into thinking there’s something like classes present, in fact the prototype mechanism is fundamentally opposite in its behavior. 
   
- Promises are a time-independent wrapper around a “future value,” which lets you reason about and compose them regardless of if the value is ready or not 
   
- it’s the combination of promises and generators that “yields” our most effective asynchronous coding pattern to date in JavaScript.
