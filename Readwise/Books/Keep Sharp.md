- every day of your life, you can make your brain better, faster, fitter, and, yes, sharper. 
   
- It is too imprecise, for one thing. Dementia can be a spectrum, ranging from mild to severe, and some of the causes of dementia are entirely reversible. 
   
- The brain can be continuously and consistently enriched throughout your life no matter your age or access to resources. 
   
- once your brain is running cleanly and smoothly, everything else follows. 
   
- Fear-based messaging will never lead to a long-term effective strategy because it is not the way we are wired. 
   
- the knowledge that you can build a better brain at any age. 
   
- Cognitive decline is not inevitable. 
   
- build what’s called “cognitive reserve,” or what scientists call “brain resiliency.” With more cognitive reserve, you can lower your risk of developing dementia. 
   
- A resilient brain can withstand ongoing trauma, think differently, stave off brain-related illnesses including depression, and retain cognitive memory for peak performance. 
   
- (We know now that diseases like Alzheimer’s start twenty to thirty years before any symptoms develop, so young people need to heed these lessons.) 
   
- (Sneak peek: Stop multitasking. Don’t spend mornings reading emails. Socialize more. Pick up the one specific activity that has long been scientifically proven to directly improve brain health— 
   
- addressing brain decline is going to come from those two camps: prevention and early intervention. 
   
- I will throw another into the mix: optimization, or continuously building a better and more resilient brain. 
   
- it is clear that with various behavior interventions such as meditation training or regular sound sleep, our brains can be put into hyperdrive status (and no, we of course don’t use just 10 percent of our brains 
   
- “I want to live my life like an incandescent lightbulb. Burn brightly my entire life, and then one day suddenly go out.” 
   
- Sleeping well is one of the easiest and most effective ways to improve all of your brain functions, as well as your ability to learn and remember new knowledge (it improves every system in the body). 
   
- Of the total blood and oxygen that is produced in our bodies, the brain steals 20 percent of it, despite being only roughly 2.5 percent of your body weight. 
   
- It weighs less than most laptop computers, yet it can perform in a way that no computer can or will ever rival. 
   
- the feature that most sets us apart from all other species is our amazing ability to think in ways that reach far beyond mere survival. 
   
- We have our own inner primitive reptilian brain that performs the same functions for us, and in fact it drives much of our behavior (perhaps more than we’d like to admit). 
   
- Cortex means bark in Latin, and in this case, it is the outer layer of the brain, full of folds, ridges, and valleys. Because the brain folds back on itself over and over again, its surface area is far larger than you might guess— 
   
- what’s called neuroplasticity, an important concept we’ll be exploring. The brain is a lot less static than we thought in the past. It’s alive, growing, learning, and changing—all throughout our lives. This dynamism offers hope for everyone looking to keep their mental faculties intact. 
   
- Your brain starts slowing down by the surprisingly young age of twenty-four, right before maximum maturity, but it peaks for different cognitive skills at different ages. 
   
- An extreme case is vocabulary skills, which may peak as late as the early seventies! 
   
- THE ESSENCE OF MEMORY, THINKING, AND HIGH MENTAL FUNCTIONING 
   
- Memories are what make us feel alive, capable, and valuable. 
   
- Memory is the most commonly recognized cognitive function, a higher brain function. In addition to memory, cognition includes attention, writing, reading, abstract thinking, decision making, problem solving, and performing everyday tasks 
   
- Memory is the cornerstone of all learning, for it is where we store knowledge and process that knowledge. 
   
- Many of us, however, mistake memory for “memorizing.” We view memory as a warehouse where we keep our knowledge when we are not using it, but that metaphor is not correct because memory is not static like a physical building. 
   
- Thus, as you read the article, your memory actually changes by both adding new information and finding a new place to put that information. 
   
- At the same time, you’re giving yourself a different way to link the new information with older, now slightly modified information. It’s complicated, and probably not at all how you have previously thought about your memory. But it is important to know that memory is fundamentally a learning process—the result of constantly interpreting and analyzing incoming information. 
   
- every time you use your memory, you change it. 
   
- the more you understand your memory, the more inspired you’ll be to improve it. 
   
- We also now know that memory is not really confined or generated in one particular location of the brain. It is a brain-wide active collaboration that involves virtually every part of it when running full throttle. 
   
- your memory is not a single system—it’s comprised of a network of systems, each playing a unique role in creating, storing, and recalling. 
   
- To improve and preserve memory at the cognitive level, you have to work on all functions of your brain. 
   
- It helps to consider memory building in three phases: encoding, storage, and retrieval. 
   
- Building a Memory (Encoding) 
   
- While the function of memory is facilitated in areas throughout the brain, the hippocampus is your brain’s memory center. 
   
- The creation of new dendrites, even weak ones, is called plasticity. It is this plasticity that can help your brain rewire itself if it is ever damaged. 
   
- As you learn new information and practice new skills, the brain builds intricate circuits of knowledge and memory (hence the saying “what wires together fires together”). 
   
- You have to pay attention to properly encode a memory. 
   
- How you pay attention to incoming data, however, may be the most important factor in how much of that information you remember. 
   
- It’s a beautiful paradox: In order to remember, we have to forget to some degree. 
   
- Short-versus Long-Term Memory (Storage) 
   
- Short-term memory is closely linked to the function of your hippocampus, while long-term memory is closely linked to functions of the outer layer of the brain, your cortex 
   
- Certain things can interrupt the process of moving a memory from short term to long term, however. Alcohol, for example, puts a glitch in the process. 
   
- Sleep deprivation can also disrupt the movement of memories from short to long term. 
   
- Retrieval 
   
- Most people see themselves as having either a “good” or a “bad” memory, but the truth is we each are fairly adept at remembering some types of things and not so great at remembering others. 
   
- A thirty-year-old can be on the road to Alzheimer’s disease but not know it. 
   
- inflammation is a common thread in all of the theories about brain decline, not to mention most other types of illness. 
   
- Preventing and treating brain ailments will not be reduced to a single action, but will entail a multipronged approach. 
   
- There will always be a place for good old-fashioned habits like eating more vegetables and working out regularly.
