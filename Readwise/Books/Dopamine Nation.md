- Our world is addicted to fleeting distracting pleasures that get us nowhere. 
   
- we’ve transformed the world from a place of scarcity to a place of overwhelming abundance: 
   
- The more dopamine in the brain’s reward pathway, the more addictive the experience. 
   
- the brain processes pleasure and pain in the same place. Further, pleasure and pain work like opposite sides of a balance. 
   
- “Persons with severe addictions are among those contemporary prophets that we ignore to our own demise, for they show us who we truly are.” 
   
- Addiction broadly defined is the continued and compulsive consumption of a substance or behavior (gambling, gaming, sex) despite its harm to self and/or others. 
   
- Seventy percent of world global deaths are attributable to modifiable behavioral risk factors like smoking, physical inactivity, and diet.
