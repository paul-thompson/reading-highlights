- starting from scratch requires a huge amount of effort. Mostly mental effort, but still an effort. 
   
- A blog is a tiny website, made by one or a handful of people, with the goal of creating information that can be beneficial to people. 
   
- By blog, I mean a personal site, or a product/company site, where you regularly write interesting content that can be beneficial to other people. 
   
- The blog must be useful to other people. Without this fundamental concept, your blog has no reason to exist. 
   
- Why a blog does matter 
   
- In my opinion, a personal blog is way better because companies and projects come and go. You might sell your company in 3 years. 
   
- A blog, on the other hand, can be made quite anonymously, you don't need to have that uniqueness that makes you liked on YouTube, you have a great channel for organic discovery of your blog posts (Google), and you are not trapped into a platform (YouTube). 
   
- Define who are your readers
