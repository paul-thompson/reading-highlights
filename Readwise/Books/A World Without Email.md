- What if email didn’t save knowledge work but instead accidentally traded minor conveniences for a major drag on real productivity (not frantic busyness, but actual results), leading to slower economic growth over the past two decades? 
   
- the knowledge sector was undervaluing concentration. 
   
- Constant communication is not something that gets in the way of real work; it has instead become totally intertwined 
   
- actual productive output gets squeezed into the early morning, or evenings and weekends, while their workdays devolve into Sisyphean battles against their inboxes—a 
   
- As email spread through the professional world in the 1980s and 1990s it introduced something novel: low-friction communication at scale. 
   
- The issue, then, is not the tool but the new way of working it introduced. 
   
- The hyperactive hive mind workflow has become ubiquitous in the knowledge sector. 
   
- It’s this workflow that causes us to spend over a third of our working hours in our inbox, checking for new messages every six minutes. 
   
- Unstructured conversation is also an effective method for identifying unexpected challenges and quickly coordinating responses. 
   
- pioneering research in psychology and neuroscience reveals that these context switches, even if brief, induce a heavy cost in terms of mental energy—reducing cognitive performance and creating a sense of exhaustion and reduced efficacy. 
   
- low-grade background hum of anxiety that many inbox-bound knowledge workers have come to assume is unavoidable, but is actually an artifact of this unfortunate mismatch between our modern tools and ancient brains. 
   
- Our belief that frenetic communication is somehow synonymous with work is largely a backfilled narrative we tell ourselves to make sense of sudden changes driven by complex dynamics. 
   
- a framework I call attention capital theory that argues for creating workflows built around processes specifically designed to help us get the most out of our human brains while minimizing unnecessary miseries. 
   
- we tend to think of knowledge workers as autonomous black boxes—ignoring the details of how they get their work done and focusing instead on providing them with clear objectives and motivational leadership. This is a mistake. 
   
- There is massive potential productivity currently latent in the knowledge sector. To unlock it will require much more systematic thinking about how best to organize the fundamental objective of getting a collection of human brains hooked together in networks to produce the most possible value in the most sustainable way. 
   
- these principles will push you to reduce digital messaging from a constant presence to something that occurs more occasionally. 
   
- a place where you spend most of your day actually working on hard things instead of talking about this work, or endlessly bouncing small tasks back and forth in messages. 
   
- any individual or organization who starts to think critically about the hyperactive hive mind workflow, then systematically replaces elements of it with processes that are more compatible with the realities of the human brain, will generate a substantial competitive edge. 
   
- I can’t predict all the details of this future, but I’m convinced it will not involve checking an inbox every six minutes. 
   
- Constant, Constant Multitasking Craziness 
   
- “Our study confirms what many of our colleagues and ourselves have been informally observing for some time: that information work is very fragmented,” Mark and her co-author, Victor González, write in the paper’s discussion section. 
   
- Unlike scheduled meetings, however, conversations held through email unfold asynchronously—there’s usually a gap between when a message is sent and ultimately read—meaning that the compacted interactions that once defined synchronous meetings are now spread out into a shattered rhythm of quick checks of inboxes throughout the day. 
   
- knowledge workers experience very fragmented workdays.” 
   
- The primary purpose of RescueTime is to provide individual users with detailed feedback on their behavior so they can find ways to be more productive. Because the tool is a web application, however, all this data is stored in central servers, which makes it possible to aggregate and analyze the time use habits of tens of thousands of users. 
   
- The implication of the RescueTime data set is striking: the modern knowledge worker is almost never more than a few minutes away from sending or receiving some sort of electronic communication. 
   
- the more realistic model is one in which knowledge workers essentially partition their attention into two parallel tracks: one executing work tasks and the other managing an always-present, ongoing, and overloaded electronic conversation about these tasks. 
   
- The Sequential Brain in a Parallel World 
   
- We take for granted our ability to pay attention. 
   
- From the perspective of a frenzied knowledge worker, a serious shortcoming of this process is that the prefrontal cortex can service only one attention target at a time. 
   
- Gazzaley and Larry Rosen bluntly summarize in their 2016 book, The Distracted Mind: “Our brains do not parallel process information.” 
   
- network switching slows down the mind. The goal of these papers, however, was to better understand how the brain operated. 
   
- The only outlier was high time pressure and a completed task: under this combination, attention residue was reduced. As Leroy hypothesizes, when a task is confined to a well-defined block of time and fully completed during this block, it’s easier to move on, mentally speaking, when you’re done. 
   
- Why is it so hard to do our work? Because our brains were never designed to maintain parallel tracks of attention. 
   
- The implication of this final quip is that there’s a small group of professions that specifically value uninterrupted hard thinking—writers, programmers, scientists—but for most positions, being in the thick of things is a major part of the job. 
   
- The flip side of this claim is that for most positions, the hyperactive hive mind workflow, which derails attempts at clear cognition, makes you less productive. 
   
- management is about more than responsiveness. Indeed, as detailed earlier in this chapter, a dedication to responsiveness will likely degrade your ability to make smart decisions and plan for future challenges—the core of Marshall’s success—and in many situations make you worse at the big picture goals of management. 
   
- Email and Slack served important purposes in Sean’s company: they’re how his team coordinated and how they interacted with their clients. If Sean had eliminated these tools without replacing the functions they served with alternative processes, his company would have fallen apart. 
   
- “The longer one spends on email in [a given] hour the higher is one’s stress for that hour. 
   
- In fact, for those who score high in the common personality trait of neuroticism, batching emails actually makes you more stressed (perhaps due to worry about all the urgent messages you’re ignoring). 
   
- when stressed, people answer emails faster, but not better—a 
   
- this rational understanding was no match for the underlying evolutionary pressures which ingrain the idea that ignoring a potential connection is really bad! 
   
- As long as we remain committed to a workflow based on constant, ad hoc messaging, our Paleolithic brain will remain in a state of low-grade anxiety. 
   
- By embracing email, we inadvertently crippled the systems that make us so good at working together. 
   
- by the fact that we often overestimate our correspondents’ ability to understand our messages. 
   
- The richer the sender’s subjective experience of what she’s trying to communicate, the bigger the gap grows between her understanding and that of her correspondent—evidence that egocentrism is at the core of the measured overconfidence. 
   
- emails are commonly misunderstood because of the “inherent difficulty of moving beyond one’s subjective experience of a stimulus and imagining how the stimulus might be evaluated by someone who does not share one’s privileged perspective.” 
   
- “Typically, things get into trouble when too much has been done by email,” 
   
- “I’m usually facing someone who wants to send twenty-nine emails to fix a problem.” His solution is simpler: “Go talk to them.” 
   
- Tools like email almost completely eliminate the effort required—in terms of both time and social capital—to ask a question or delegate a task. 
   
- But as the 1980s gave way to the 1990s, the idea that your day could be captured by a short list of coded tasks became quaint. “ 
   
- Allen rose to fame within time management circles at the same time that the hyperactive hive mind rose toward ubiquity. 
   
- Getting-things-done rookies are often shocked by the length of their task lists. 
   
- Simply adding a small amount of friction significantly reduced the requests coming 
   
- If slightly increasing friction drastically reduces the requests made on your time and attention, then most of these requests are not vital to your organization’s operation in the first place; 
   
- we’re used to thinking about more efficiency producing more effectiveness, but among engineers like me, this concept is commonly understood. Too little friction can lead to feedback loops that spiral out of control, 
   
- Friction also motivates the development of more intelligent processes. Imagine 
   
- When we made communication free, we accidentally triggered a massive increase in our relative workloads. 
   
- Clarifying the Misery Mechanisms 
   
- three specific ways in which the hyperactive hive mind workflow makes us unhappy: 
   
- the psychological anxiety of an inbox that fills up faster than we can empty it, the frustrating ineffectiveness of text-only communication, and the out-of-control overload that results when friction is eliminated from office interactions. 
   
- replace the hyperactive hive mind with alternative workflows that still get things done, but sidestep the worst of these misery-inducing side effects. 
   
- synchronous messaging, which requires all parties in the interaction to participate at the same time. 
   
- asynchronous messaging, which doesn’t require a receiver to be present when a message is sent. 
   
- In 1987, it’s a clunky tool useful to only a “niche market.” By 1994, it’s the “killer app” of the decade and the foundation of a half-billion-dollar software industry. 
   
- the need for high-speed asynchronous communication—and did so in a manner that was relatively inexpensive and easy to master. 
   
- Over time, this idea that tools can sometimes drive human behavior became known as technological determinism. 
   
- this idea that tools can sometimes drive human behavior became known as technological determinism. 
   
- Postman replies that the influence of the resulting “typographic” culture did more than just speed up information flow; it changed the way our brains processed our world. 
   
- A key property of technological determinism is that the innovation in question alters our behavior in ways that were neither intended nor predicted by those first adopting the tool. 
   
- The case study of Adrian Stone and IBM is pure technological determinism: a tool introduced for a simple purpose (to make existing communication practices more efficient) had an unexpected result (a shift toward the hyperactive hive mind style of collaboration). 
   
- We chose to use email because it was a rational solution to the need for practical asynchronous communication in large offices. 
   
- To many, this asynchronous approach to communication seemed strictly more efficient. 
   
- email didn’t live up to its billing as a productivity silver bullet. The quick phone call, it turns out, cannot always be replaced with a single quick message, but instead often requires dozens of ambiguous digital notes passed back and forth to replicate the interactive nature of conversation. 
   
- The synchrony-versus-asynchrony issue is fundamental to the history of computer science. 
   
- Writing distributed system algorithms that could handle this asynchrony turned out to be much harder than many engineers originally believed. 
   
- Because delays are unpredictable in an asynchronous system, the waiting peers don’t know when they should give up and move on with the votes they’ve already gathered. 
   
- asynchronous communication complicates attempts to coordinate, and therefore, it’s almost always worth the extra cost required to introduce more synchrony. 
   
- What’s striking about these technical results on asynchrony versus synchrony is how much they diverge from the conclusions of the business thinkers tackling these same issues in the workplace. 
   
- Computer scientists, meanwhile, came to the opposite conclusion. Investigating asynchronous communication from the perspective of algorithm theory, they discovered that spreading out communication with unpredictable delays introduced tricky new complexities. 
   
- While the business world came to see synchrony as an obstacle to overcome, computer theorists began to realize that it was fundamental for effective collaboration. 
   
- Synchrony might be expensive to arrange—both in the office setting and in computer systems—but trying to coordinate in its absence is also expensive. 
   
- What she uncovered was a social feedback loop gone awry—a process she named the cycle of responsiveness. 
   
- teammates, superiors and subordinates continue to make more requests, and conscientious employees accept these marginal increases in demands on their time, while their expectations of each other (and themselves) rise accordingly.24 
   
- The important lesson from Perlow’s work is the haphazard and unplanned manner in which an entirely new way of communicating emerged. 
   
- actual productive output gets squeezed into the early morning, or evenings and weekends, while their workdays devolve into Sisyphean battles against their inboxes 
   
- Gazzaley and Larry Rosen bluntly summarize in their 2016 book, The Distracted Mind: “Our brains do not parallel process 
   
- when stressed, people answer emails faster, but not better 
   
- Hive Mind Driver #1: The Hidden Costs of Asynchrony 
   
- the need for efficient asynchronous communication—that is, a fast way to send messages back and forth without requiring the sender and receiver to be communicating at the same time. 
   
- Hive Mind Driver #3: The Caveman at the Computer Screen 
   
- It doesn’t require a large leap of speculative evolutionary psychology to arrive at the reasonable conclusion that Homo sapiens are well adapted to small-group collaboration. 
   
- Ringelmann’s work proved influential, as it introduced the general idea that increasing the size of a team doesn’t necessarily increase its effectiveness in direct proportion. 
   
- Though there’s no specific team size that consistently emerges as optimal, essentially every result falls into a narrow range of roughly four to twelve people— 
   
- (Summarized simply: the more people working on a project, the easier it is to get away with putting in less effort.) 
   
- Throughout most of human history we worked together in small groups, communicating in an ad hoc fashion without any particular structure or rules. 
   
- “The knowledge worker cannot be supervised closely or in detail,” Drucker wrote in his 1967 book, The Effective Executive. “He must direct himself.” 
   
- knowledge workers often knew more about their specialties than those who managed them. The best way to deploy these highly skilled individuals, Drucker concluded, was to give them clear objectives and then leave them alone to accomplish their brainy work however they saw fit. 
   
- Similarly, if you unilaterally decrease the time you spend checking your inbox in a group that depends on the hive mind, you’ll slow down other people’s efforts, generating annoyance and dissatisfaction that might put your job in jeopardy. 
   
- to solve the tragedy of the commons, you cannot expect substantially better behavior from the herders; you need instead to replace the free-for-all grazing system with something more efficient. The same holds for the hyperactive hive mind: we cannot tame it with minor hacks—we need to replace it with a better workflow. 
   
- In the knowledge sector, by contrast, the primary capital resources are the human brains you employ to add value to information—what I call attention capital. 
   
- This new workflow encourages single-tasking. 
   
- This allows them to remain focused on one thing until they’re ready to move on. When using a general-purpose inbox, by contrast, they were constantly switching back and forth between many different projects, 
   
- On the one hand, autonomy is unavoidable in knowledge work due to the complexity of these efforts. On the other hand, autonomy entrenches hive mind–style workflows. 
   
- Knowledge work is better understood as the combination of two components: work execution and workflow. The first component, work execution, describes the act of actually executing the underlying value-producing activities of knowledge work—the programmer coding, 
   
- It describes how these fundamental activities are identified, assigned, coordinated, and reviewed. The hyperactive hive mind is a workflow, 
   
- If work execution is what generates value, then workflows are what structure these efforts. 
   
- Differentiating workflows and work execution is crucial if we’re going to continue to improve knowledge sector productivity. 
   
- there’s a large cognitive cost to switching your attention from one target to another. 
   
- seek workflows that (1) minimize mid-task context switches and (2) minimize the sense of communication overload. 
   
- In open office settings, for example, you might be frequently interrupted by people stopping by your seat with questions, and if your workflow demands constant meetings, then this, too, will fracture your schedule into slivers too small to support start-to-finish work on tasks. 
   
- The optimal way to deploy our human brains is sequentially. 
   
- workflows that minimize this never-ending stream of urgent communication are superior to those that instead amplify it. 
   
- you must still monitor the key bottom line metric: the quantity and quality of valuable output you’re producing. 
   
- The key is to find ways to minimize context shifts and overload while still getting done what needs to get done. 
   
- Little attention is dedicated to the actual mechanics of how work is assigned, executed, and reviewed. 
   
- Deep down, knowledge workers want to feel as if they’re producing important output that takes full advantage of their hard-won skills, even if this means they can’t always get a quick response to their messages. 
   
- The attention capital principle asks you to experiment instead with the workflows that structure how this work is assigned and reviewed. 
   
- make it both easier and more sustainable for the knowledge worker to actually accomplish important things, not to coerce them into doing more things, faster 
   
- There are two ways applying the attention capital principle can impact the people with whom you work. 
   
- it alters workflows in such a way that people are forced to change how they execute their own work. 
   
- The second type of impact changes only other people’s expectations about your own work. This applies when you focus on upgrading your personal workflow. 
   
- knowledge work will always be defined by large amounts of autonomous action. 
   
- A better strategy for shifting others’ expectations about your work is to consistently deliver what you promise instead of consistently explaining how you’re working. 
   
- The better you are at what you do, he explains, the more freedom you earn to be idiosyncratic in how you deliver—no explanation required. 
   
- people don’t like changes they can’t control. 
   
- without this structure, you’re left with only one option for increasing productivity: figuring out how to get people to “work faster.” Once you see the whole process, however, a much more powerful option emerges: “We can change the nature of the work performed.” Optimize processes, he urged, not people. 
   
- production process thinking applies equally well to knowledge work as it does to industrial manufacturing. 
   
- Production processes, by definition, require rules about how work is coordinated. Rules reduce autonomy—creating friction with the belief that knowledge workers “must manage themselves,” as Peter Drucker commanded. 
   
- we default to our instinct to not expend any more energy than is necessary. 
   
- To move past the shortcomings of the hyperactive hive mind workflow, we must abandon our Rousseauian optimism that knowledge workers left to a state of nature will thrive. 
   
- I’ve become a big advocate of deploying task boards not just to organize teams, but to organize your individual life as a knowledge worker as well. 
   
- Individual task boards can significantly improve the quality of your life as a knowledge worker, but only if you invest sufficient time in their upkeep. 
   
- If you want to unlock the power of personal task boards to minimize hive mind–style back-and-forth messaging, this hack is probably the most important one you’ll encounter in this chapter. 
   
- A regular rhythm of efficient meetings can replace 90 percent of hive mind messaging, 
   
- This advantage is true of most automatic processes: eliminating unnecessary coordination does not just reduce frustration, but also increases resources to invest in the activities that really matter. 
   
- As explained by the management consultant Rory Vaden, in its original form, this rule states: “You should spend 30x the amount of time training someone to do a task than it would take you to do the task yourself one time.” 
   
- Making Individual Work Automatic 
   
- the goal remains to minimize both the cognitive energy and the back-and-forth communication required to finish your tasks, only now, the steps of the process are entirely under your control. 
   
- The key was to reduce cognitive energy wasted on planning or decision making, allowing the student to focus simply on execution. 
   
- Whether you’re deploying complex automation or just following handcrafted procedures, these processes will reduce your dependence on the hyperactive hive mind workflow and reward you with extra cognitive energy and mental peace. 
   
- by adding complexity to the rules we use to structure our communication, the actual amount of information required by the interactions can be reduced. 
   
- This was the central idea of Shannon’s information theory framework: clever protocols that take into account the structure of the information being communicated can perform much better than naïve approaches. 
   
- In honor of Shannon, let’s call these collections of rules coordination protocols. 
   
- Shannon’s information theory framework teaches us that for a given task, the protocol you choose matters, as some are costlier than others. 
   
- If a protocol induces a long delay for someone to receive critical information, or requires extra effort on the part of the sender or receiver, or leads to a missed opportunity, then this generates inconvenience. 
   
- Our instinct in the knowledge work setting is to obsess about factors like worst-case scenarios—how can we prevent bad things from ever happening?!—or to prefer the convenience of simple (but costly) protocols to more finicky (but optimized) alternatives. 
   
- A key element of any workflow is the means by which people coordinate their work. This coordination requires communication, and whether or not you use this terminology, this in turn requires the people involved to agree in advance on a set of rules about how and when the communication occurs—what we call a coordination protocol. 
   
- sometimes a little extra complexity can unlock a lot more performance. 
   
- When you have to continually return to your inbox to nudge along one of many different meeting-scheduling conversations, your ability to perform valuable cognitive work significantly diminishes. 
   
- If the meeting involves multiple people, then avoiding email ping-pong becomes even more urgent, as the number of messages required for scheduling often increases exponentially with the number of attendees. 
   
- For most types of coordination, moving to predetermined office hours will significantly reduce the cognitive cycle cost compared with simply bouncing messages back and forth in an ad hoc fashion. Having to wait until the next scheduled office hour to communicate, however, can induce an inconvenience cost. Office hour protocols seem to work best for activities that are not too negatively impacted by these delays. 
   
- This is also why my 2016 suggestion of replacing all communication with office hours landed with a thud: there are many types of coordination currently handled over email for which long delays would be prohibitively costly. 
   
- when seeking to minimize costs, consider the client’s cost in addition to your own. A key factor that helps a client protocol work is if it reduces the cognitive cycles or inconveniences that the client faces as well. 
   
- The jump from CTSS to email was natural. One of the features time-sharing introduced was the idea that each user account had its own directory containing its own files, some private and some accessible to everyone else on the system. Clever early users of CTSS realized they could leave messages in one another’s directories. 
   
- This arbitrary and seemingly innocent decision to associate email with individuals ended up playing a role in the rise of the hyperactive hive mind workflow. 
   
- if you put such a disclaimer next to a personalized address, like cal@calnewport.com, it will be widely disregarded, as our expectations for one-on-one interactions are so strong. But when the disclaimer appends a nonpersonal address, like interesting@calnew port.com, I receive few complaints—without preconceived expectations, you’re able to set them from scratch. 
   
- The idea of strictly limiting email length is more than a gimmick. It instead represents a step that too few take in our current digital age: the placing of clear constraints around what email should and should not be used to accomplish. 
   
- The short-email movement pushes back on this commitment. It specifies email as something useful for short questions, short answers, and short updates, but demands that anything more complicated be handled using a different type of communication better suited to the exchange. 
   
- When deployed properly, these short-message policies implement efficient protocols that use email for the type of communication for which it’s best suited (quick and asynchronous), forcing people onto better mediums for everything else. 
   
- Scrum, software development teams break up work into sprints: sessions lasting two to four weeks that are dedicated to developing a specific set of features. During the sprints, the team meets every morning for fifteen minutes, in a gathering called a scrum. 
   
- During this meeting, each person in the group answers the following three questions: (1) What did you do since the last scrum meeting? (2) Do you have any obstacles? (3) What will you do before the next scrum? 
   
- Short, structured check-ins can be empowering. 
   
- Status meetings, by contrast, are both frequent and structured in the questions they demand of participants: What did you do, what are you going to do, what’s in your way? 
   
- When you eliminate support staff, the skilled professionals become less intellectually specialized, as they have to spend more time on administrative work that computers made just easy enough for them to handle on their own. 
   
- “Indeed, in many instances firms have used technology to decrease, rather than to increase, intellectual specialization,” 
   
- If we want to tame the hyperactive hive mind, therefore, we must first tame the trend toward non-specialization. 
   
- The Specialization Principle In the knowledge sector, working on fewer things, but doing each thing with more quality and accountability, can be the foundation for significantly more productivity. 
   
- Woodward describes these conversations as “one hundred times more efficient than email.” 
   
- Furthermore, given a work culture in which you’re expected to give your full attention to the problem at hand, with a project manager shielding you from distractions, you end up spending most of your day actually accomplishing hard things. 
   
- XP is as close to a pure deep work environment as I’ve ever seen deployed successfully. 
   
- “The average engineer at a non-XP company may only do two to three hours of actual work a day; the rest of the time is spent surfing the web and checking email.” 
   
- busyness [is],” she writes, but this “whirlwind” isn’t compatible with producing accomplishments that provide lasting meaning and pride. 
   
- In the world of computer programming, XP gained this minimalism through a strict set of rules, enforced by the management, that had been polished over decades of practice. 
   
- If you run your own business or freelance, once you adopt this mindset that unskilled activities slow down your growth, you’ll begin to notice numerous opportunities to reduce non-vital efforts. 
   
- Work Reduction Strategy #2: Trade Accountability for Autonomy 
   
- to gain something valuable like autonomy means you have to offer something unambiguously valuable in return. 
   
- If you spend more time on the high-value activities at the expense of spending less time on the low-value activities, you’ll produce more value overall. 
   
- Sprint, Don’t Wander 
   
- One of the key ideas from our extreme programming case study was the importance of working on one objective at a time, without interruption, until it’s complete. 
   
- During a Scrum sprint, a team works exclusively on a single specific deliverable, such as adding a new feature to a software product 
   
- Regular sprints also support longer-term changes to your workload by making it easier for individual knowledge workers to lobby for fewer obligations overall. 
   
- why bother hiring a hotshot if the bulk of their time is spent doing administrative work? 
   
- Meeting budgets are also common. The idea is to block off on your calendar the times you’re available for meetings. 
   
- Using a task board to organize work offers two benefits in this context: it makes it easy to determine how much work each person is currently doing, and it has a structured system for how these work assignments are updated, usually in the form of a status meeting attended by everyone. 
   
- Programmers who deploy extreme programming, for example, spend much less time in meetings and answering emails than their peers, but their companies seem to do just fine without this extra activity. 
   
- Most modern knowledge work organizations treat individuals as general-purpose computers that execute a turbulent mixture of value-producing and administrative tasks 
   
- Returning to a culture that allows more separation between specialized and administrative work is crucial to moving past the hyperactive hive mind and significantly improving productivity. 
   
- when it comes to support, workflows matter. 
   
- In most knowledge work settings, it’s the specialists who directly produce the valuable output that sustains their organization. 
   
- If a knowledge work organization is producing valuable cognitive output in a competitive marketplace, then it’s self-evident that having support units prioritize this output will make an organization more successful than if it instead allowed every unit to focus myopically on its own internal objectives. 
   
- One way to accomplish this goal is to partition your time into two separate categories: specialist and support. For example, perhaps 12:00 to 1:00 p.m. and 3:00 to 5:00 p.m. are support hours. 
   
- idea of pretending to be two different types of workers might seem heavy-handed, but there’s a surprising amount of efficiency to be gained by isolating these distinct categories of effort. 
   
- Technological change is not additive; it is ecological 
   
- “Knowledge worker productivity is the moonshot of the twenty-first century.” 
   
- attention capital theory. Once you accept that the primary capital resource in knowledge work is the human brains you employ (or, more accurately, these brains’ capacity to focus on information and produce new information that’s more valuable), 
   
- “We need to proceed with our eyes wide open,” concluded Postman, “so that we may use technology rather than be used by it.”
