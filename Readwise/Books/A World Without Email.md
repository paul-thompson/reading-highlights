- What if email didn’t save knowledge work but instead accidentally traded minor conveniences for a major drag on real productivity (not frantic busyness, but actual results), leading to slower economic growth over the past two decades? 
   
- the knowledge sector was undervaluing concentration. 
   
- Constant communication is not something that gets in the way of real work; it has instead become totally intertwined 
   
- actual productive output gets squeezed into the early morning, or evenings and weekends, while their workdays devolve into Sisyphean battles against their inboxes—a 
   
- As email spread through the professional world in the 1980s and 1990s it introduced something novel: low-friction communication at scale. 
   
- The issue, then, is not the tool but the new way of working it introduced. 
   
- The hyperactive hive mind workflow has become ubiquitous in the knowledge sector. 
   
- It’s this workflow that causes us to spend over a third of our working hours in our inbox, checking for new messages every six minutes. 
   
- Unstructured conversation is also an effective method for identifying unexpected challenges and quickly coordinating responses. 
   
- pioneering research in psychology and neuroscience reveals that these context switches, even if brief, induce a heavy cost in terms of mental energy—reducing cognitive performance and creating a sense of exhaustion and reduced efficacy. 
   
- low-grade background hum of anxiety that many inbox-bound knowledge workers have come to assume is unavoidable, but is actually an artifact of this unfortunate mismatch between our modern tools and ancient brains. 
   
- Our belief that frenetic communication is somehow synonymous with work is largely a backfilled narrative we tell ourselves to make sense of sudden changes driven by complex dynamics. 
   
- a framework I call attention capital theory that argues for creating workflows built around processes specifically designed to help us get the most out of our human brains while minimizing unnecessary miseries. 
   
- we tend to think of knowledge workers as autonomous black boxes—ignoring the details of how they get their work done and focusing instead on providing them with clear objectives and motivational leadership. This is a mistake. 
   
- There is massive potential productivity currently latent in the knowledge sector. To unlock it will require much more systematic thinking about how best to organize the fundamental objective of getting a collection of human brains hooked together in networks to produce the most possible value in the most sustainable way. 
   
- these principles will push you to reduce digital messaging from a constant presence to something that occurs more occasionally. 
   
- a place where you spend most of your day actually working on hard things instead of talking about this work, or endlessly bouncing small tasks back and forth in messages. 
   
- any individual or organization who starts to think critically about the hyperactive hive mind workflow, then systematically replaces elements of it with processes that are more compatible with the realities of the human brain, will generate a substantial competitive edge. 
   
- I can’t predict all the details of this future, but I’m convinced it will not involve checking an inbox every six minutes. 
   
- Constant, Constant Multitasking Craziness 
   
- “Our study confirms what many of our colleagues and ourselves have been informally observing for some time: that information work is very fragmented,” Mark and her co-author, Victor González, write in the paper’s discussion section. 
   
- Unlike scheduled meetings, however, conversations held through email unfold asynchronously—there’s usually a gap between when a message is sent and ultimately read—meaning that the compacted interactions that once defined synchronous meetings are now spread out into a shattered rhythm of quick checks of inboxes throughout the day. 
   
- knowledge workers experience very fragmented workdays.” 
   
- The primary purpose of RescueTime is to provide individual users with detailed feedback on their behavior so they can find ways to be more productive. Because the tool is a web application, however, all this data is stored in central servers, which makes it possible to aggregate and analyze the time use habits of tens of thousands of users. 
   
- The implication of the RescueTime data set is striking: the modern knowledge worker is almost never more than a few minutes away from sending or receiving some sort of electronic communication. 
   
- the more realistic model is one in which knowledge workers essentially partition their attention into two parallel tracks: one executing work tasks and the other managing an always-present, ongoing, and overloaded electronic conversation about these tasks. 
   
- The Sequential Brain in a Parallel World 
   
- We take for granted our ability to pay attention. 
   
- From the perspective of a frenzied knowledge worker, a serious shortcoming of this process is that the prefrontal cortex can service only one attention target at a time. 
   
- Gazzaley and Larry Rosen bluntly summarize in their 2016 book, The Distracted Mind: “Our brains do not parallel process information.” 
   
- network switching slows down the mind. The goal of these papers, however, was to better understand how the brain operated. 
   
- The only outlier was high time pressure and a completed task: under this combination, attention residue was reduced. As Leroy hypothesizes, when a task is confined to a well-defined block of time and fully completed during this block, it’s easier to move on, mentally speaking, when you’re done. 
   
- Why is it so hard to do our work? Because our brains were never designed to maintain parallel tracks of attention. 
   
- The implication of this final quip is that there’s a small group of professions that specifically value uninterrupted hard thinking—writers, programmers, scientists—but for most positions, being in the thick of things is a major part of the job. 
   
- The flip side of this claim is that for most positions, the hyperactive hive mind workflow, which derails attempts at clear cognition, makes you less productive. 
   
- management is about more than responsiveness. Indeed, as detailed earlier in this chapter, a dedication to responsiveness will likely degrade your ability to make smart decisions and plan for future challenges—the core of Marshall’s success—and in many situations make you worse at the big picture goals of management. 
   
- Email and Slack served important purposes in Sean’s company: they’re how his team coordinated and how they interacted with their clients. If Sean had eliminated these tools without replacing the functions they served with alternative processes, his company would have fallen apart. 
   
- “The longer one spends on email in [a given] hour the higher is one’s stress for that hour. 
   
- In fact, for those who score high in the common personality trait of neuroticism, batching emails actually makes you more stressed (perhaps due to worry about all the urgent messages you’re ignoring). 
   
- when stressed, people answer emails faster, but not better—a 
   
- this rational understanding was no match for the underlying evolutionary pressures which ingrain the idea that ignoring a potential connection is really bad! 
   
- As long as we remain committed to a workflow based on constant, ad hoc messaging, our Paleolithic brain will remain in a state of low-grade anxiety. 
   
- By embracing email, we inadvertently crippled the systems that make us so good at working together. 
   
- by the fact that we often overestimate our correspondents’ ability to understand our messages. 
   
- The richer the sender’s subjective experience of what she’s trying to communicate, the bigger the gap grows between her understanding and that of her correspondent—evidence that egocentrism is at the core of the measured overconfidence. 
   
- emails are commonly misunderstood because of the “inherent difficulty of moving beyond one’s subjective experience of a stimulus and imagining how the stimulus might be evaluated by someone who does not share one’s privileged perspective.” 
   
- “Typically, things get into trouble when too much has been done by email,” 
   
- “I’m usually facing someone who wants to send twenty-nine emails to fix a problem.” His solution is simpler: “Go talk to them.” 
   
- Tools like email almost completely eliminate the effort required—in terms of both time and social capital—to ask a question or delegate a task. 
   
- But as the 1980s gave way to the 1990s, the idea that your day could be captured by a short list of coded tasks became quaint. “ 
   
- Allen rose to fame within time management circles at the same time that the hyperactive hive mind rose toward ubiquity. 
   
- Getting-things-done rookies are often shocked by the length of their task lists. 
   
- Simply adding a small amount of friction significantly reduced the requests coming 
   
- If slightly increasing friction drastically reduces the requests made on your time and attention, then most of these requests are not vital to your organization’s operation in the first place; 
   
- we’re used to thinking about more efficiency producing more effectiveness, but among engineers like me, this concept is commonly understood. Too little friction can lead to feedback loops that spiral out of control, 
   
- Friction also motivates the development of more intelligent processes. Imagine 
   
- When we made communication free, we accidentally triggered a massive increase in our relative workloads. 
   
- Clarifying the Misery Mechanisms 
   
- three specific ways in which the hyperactive hive mind workflow makes us unhappy: 
   
- the psychological anxiety of an inbox that fills up faster than we can empty it, the frustrating ineffectiveness of text-only communication, and the out-of-control overload that results when friction is eliminated from office interactions. 
   
- replace the hyperactive hive mind with alternative workflows that still get things done, but sidestep the worst of these misery-inducing side effects. 
   
- synchronous messaging, which requires all parties in the interaction to participate at the same time. 
   
- asynchronous messaging, which doesn’t require a receiver to be present when a message is sent. 
   
- In 1987, it’s a clunky tool useful to only a “niche market.” By 1994, it’s the “killer app” of the decade and the foundation of a half-billion-dollar software industry. 
   
- the need for high-speed asynchronous communication—and did so in a manner that was relatively inexpensive and easy to master. 
   
- Over time, this idea that tools can sometimes drive human behavior became known as technological determinism. 
   
- this idea that tools can sometimes drive human behavior became known as technological determinism. 
   
- Postman replies that the influence of the resulting “typographic” culture did more than just speed up information flow; it changed the way our brains processed our world. 
   
- A key property of technological determinism is that the innovation in question alters our behavior in ways that were neither intended nor predicted by those first adopting the tool. 
   
- The case study of Adrian Stone and IBM is pure technological determinism: a tool introduced for a simple purpose (to make existing communication practices more efficient) had an unexpected result (a shift toward the hyperactive hive mind style of collaboration). 
   
- We chose to use email because it was a rational solution to the need for practical asynchronous communication in large offices. 
   
- To many, this asynchronous approach to communication seemed strictly more efficient. 
   
- email didn’t live up to its billing as a productivity silver bullet. The quick phone call, it turns out, cannot always be replaced with a single quick message, but instead often requires dozens of ambiguous digital notes passed back and forth to replicate the interactive nature of conversation. 
   
- The synchrony-versus-asynchrony issue is fundamental to the history of computer science. 
   
- Writing distributed system algorithms that could handle this asynchrony turned out to be much harder than many engineers originally believed. 
   
- Because delays are unpredictable in an asynchronous system, the waiting peers don’t know when they should give up and move on with the votes they’ve already gathered. 
   
- asynchronous communication complicates attempts to coordinate, and therefore, it’s almost always worth the extra cost required to introduce more synchrony. 
   
- What’s striking about these technical results on asynchrony versus synchrony is how much they diverge from the conclusions of the business thinkers tackling these same issues in the workplace. 
   
- Computer scientists, meanwhile, came to the opposite conclusion. Investigating asynchronous communication from the perspective of algorithm theory, they discovered that spreading out communication with unpredictable delays introduced tricky new complexities. 
   
- While the business world came to see synchrony as an obstacle to overcome, computer theorists began to realize that it was fundamental for effective collaboration. 
   
- Synchrony might be expensive to arrange—both in the office setting and in computer systems—but trying to coordinate in its absence is also expensive. 
   
- What she uncovered was a social feedback loop gone awry—a process she named the cycle of responsiveness. 
   
- teammates, superiors and subordinates continue to make more requests, and conscientious employees accept these marginal increases in demands on their time, while their expectations of each other (and themselves) rise accordingly.24 
   
- The important lesson from Perlow’s work is the haphazard and unplanned manner in which an entirely new way of communicating emerged.
