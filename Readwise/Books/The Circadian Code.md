- Optimizing Learning and Working 
   
- Attention 
   
- Attention is the ability to stay focused and complete a task without distraction. 
   
- Unless we pay attention, we cannot create memories. 
   
- Attention has a circadian component. We have an internal drive to be more attentive during the day and are naturally prone to being less attentive at night. 
   
- Working memory is the most important function of the human brain; 
   
- When your working memory is functioning at a high level, you perform well at home and at school. When it is low, you feel scattered, forgetful, and sometimes anxious. 
   
- Sleep deprivation compromises your working memory by affecting your reaction time.
