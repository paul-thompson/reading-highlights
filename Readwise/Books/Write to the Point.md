- “Complaints about the decline of language go at least as far back as the invention of the printing press.” 
   
- Does a language have rules? Yes, in one sense it does. It would not work if it didn’t. But it doesn’t have an umpire. 
   
- every sentence you utter is grammatical; if it were not, nobody would be able to understand you. 
   
- Knowing your audience is always more important than knowing a set of rules and prohibitions. 
   
- To write clearly is an essential courtesy, and to write well is to give pleasure to your audience. 
   
- English was not designed as a logical system. It was not designed at all. 
   
- The difference between herb and erb is what’s sometimes called a shibboleth: a word or pronunciation that distinguishes one language community from another. 
   
- you’re not interested in proving them wrong; you’re interested in getting them on your side. Indulge them. If that’s the sort of person you’re writing to, 
   
- One of the sociological features of standard English is that many of its users place a high value on getting it right. 
   
- “You can make anybody look like an idiot by quoting them verbatim,” 
   
- Speech and writing are different things; more different than we often notice. 
   
- to write as you speak is much more easily said than done. Speaking is natural; writing is artificial. You cannot write exactly as you speak, nor should you. 
   
- written and spoken languages have different formal properties and slightly different grammars. 
   
- the spoken language tends to be much more loosely packed and less structured than the written version. 
   
- The question of what you might call tone of voice, of the right level of formality, is what’s known as decorum or, sometimes, register. 
   
- You’re trying to capture the spontaneity and directness of spoken communication on the page without sounding stiff or pompous. 
   
- writing is a representation of speech, not a transcription of it. 
   
- Hours of agonized concentration at the keyboard translates, at the other end of the process, into a few minutes of interested attention on the page. 
   
- you need to try to experience it as a reader, not as a writer. And in practice, this means rereading. 
   
- Learning to read is more painstaking and more artificial than learning to speak or learning to listen. 
   
- Broca’s area is associated with rhythm and syntax—with what you might call the structural features of the language. 
   
- Wernicke’s area specializes in words and meaning—i.e., the content. 
   
- people reading on screens find the process more mentally taxing, and (perhaps consequently) that they less easily and less thoroughly remember what they have read. 
   
- we approach on-screen reading with less concentration than we do the dead-tree kind. We expect to be distracted; we expect to read less deeply—and 
   
- Day-to-day practical writing is not about making words look pretty on the page or showing stylistic sophistication or an impressive vocabulary. It’s about connecting with the reader. 
   
- Pathos is the way in which we are swayed by emotion. Logos is the intellectual shape of an argument. But ethos is more important than both of these two. It comes first. It describes the bond a speaker or writer forges with his or her audience. 
   
- Ethos, overwhelmingly often, boils down to the question: Do they think of you as “one of us”? 
   
- For the sentence to be meaningful, it relies on a common understanding of these definitions, and the awareness that until you hear different, it’s safest to keep your interpretive options open. 
   
- The point is that the successful communicator takes as much of the work of interpretation on him- or herself as possible. If your frame of reference is different from your audience’s, you reach them faster by adopting theirs. 
   
- We think in sets and groups but we also feel in sets and groups. 
   
- Small talk is primarily phatic. And, conversely, a number of other elements of language—from 
   
- Stylistically, it means trying to minimize ambiguity. It means being simple without being patronizing, and clear without being obvious. 
   
- Plain English, simply, makes the reader’s life easy. It minimizes the cognitive work he or she has to put in. 
   
- Something that’s easy for the reader to consume isn’t necessarily easy for the writer to produce. 
   
- specialist language can, in effect, do for scientists what plain English does for the general reader: minimize the cognitive work. 
   
- Plain English aims to be understood, then, by the maximum number of readers in any given audience with the maximum ease. 
   
- According to the UK’s National Literacy Trust, the average reading level among adults in Britain corresponds to the target level for thirteen-year-olds. 
   
- Unclear writing wastes time and money. 
   
- grammatical English helps your ethos appeal. People judge you on your language. 
   
- The writer who aims for the stupidest and least attentive person in his or her audience is not a stupid or inattentive writer. 
   
- For many years, a number of mechanical “readability tests” have been in circulation. The best known is probably the Flesch-Kincaid score—which 
   
- It’s the familiarity of a given word, rather than its syllabic length, that makes the main difference to a reader. And when it comes to sentences, syntactic structure is far more important to readability than bare length. 
   
- don’t treat these scores as anything more than a finger to the wind. 
   
- Making something readable is work that needs to be done by the writer, sentence by sentence. 
   
- Muddled writing and muddled thought often go together. If you can write something clearly, it’s almost always a sign that you are thinking it clearly. 
   
- Hitting the Right Note 
   
- in linguistics gets called “register,” and in rhetoric gets called “decorum.” It’s how language changes according to the particular social circumstance of its use: 
   
- If the mistake of the pedant is to mistake that dialect for the only dialect, it’s a mistake of the naive anything-goes relativist to think that correctness doesn’t matter at all. 
   
- The task of the good writer, you could say, is to find a position in the happy middle ground between the berks and the wankers. 
   
- Why say “prior to” rather than “before”? Everybody knows what “before” means. 
   
- Within the trade those few syllables get the meaning across with maximum economy. 
   
- You could say that as our brains get more powerful, we find it easier to handle abstraction. 
   
- It’s not a question of avoiding abstraction altogether, it’s a question of allocating resources sensibly. 
   
- the stronger the verb and more concrete the nouns you use, the more impact and directness any given sentence will have. 
   
- Nouns and Pronouns 
   
- Nouns, we’re usefully told at elementary school, are words that stand in for things: commonly objects in the world (“cat”), people (“Donald”), concepts (“antidisestablishmentarianism”), feelings (“sadness”), and situations (“disaster”). 
   
- There are two main types of noun. 
   
- PROPER NOUNS 
   
- denote one specific thing and one thing only—such as “Julio,” “Scotch tape,” “Madonna,” or “the Taj Mahal.” 
   
- They’re easy to spot because they take a capital letter. 
   
- The thing is that in any given context they will only denote one of them. 
   
- COMMON NOUNS 
   
- These are nouns that denote, out of context, a whole category of things—such as “cat,” “intelligence,” “pop singer,” or “sadness.” They indicate something general. 
   
- Common nouns are often modified by determiners—such as “this,” “the,” or “my”—which make them, in context, more specific. 
   
- when you consider how many of our most useful nouns are, in isolation, as ambiguous as hell, it becomes clear that actually their imprecision is arguably more important. 
   
- When it comes to grammar, English nouns are as easy as pie. They account for at least half of the language’s total vocabulary and—hurrah!—they don’t inflect.
