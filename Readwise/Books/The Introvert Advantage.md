- Shame impels us to withdraw and conceal ourselves. 
   
- Introverts may also think that what bothers them—for example, interruptions—bothers everyone. 
   
- the bigger picture of how we are all interconnected, 
   
- Tell yourself that you are not flawed. Nothing is wrong with you. Your brain works in another way. Mulling is a useful activity. It’s good to be you. 
   
- Keep high aspirations, moderate expectations and small needs. —H. STEIN 
   
- In doing so, you can become a confident introvert, less vulnerable to getting overtired, experiencing a mind gone blank, or feeling shamed and blamed by others. Let’s give it a try. 
   
- He saw each variation of temperament as requiring its own optimal environment, a natural niche where it could flower. Having people who thrive in different optimal environments increases the chances of survival of the human race as a whole. It is nature’s way to preserve her species. 
   
- Often introverts have trouble finding the word they want when they are speaking out loud. 
   
- acetylcholine, energy-conserving, parasympathetic nervous system. 
   
- Human memory is complex and uses many different areas of the brain. The brain stores memories in numerous locations and creates links between them called associations. Often we introverts think nothing relevant is in our head because we haven’t triggered the association to our long-term memory. Our mind seems blank. This is why introverts can even forget what we like to do or what we are good at. We need to locate a connecting handle to yank an experience out of our memory. Here’s the neat thing—most pieces of information in long-term memory were stored with several handles or keys (associations) for unlocking them. If we find just one key, we can retrieve the whole 
   
- • Reduce eye contact when speaking to focus on collecting words and thoughts; increase eye contact when listening to take in information 
   
- • Can forget things they know very well—might stumble around when explaining their job or temporarily forget a word they want to use 
   
- One of the reason’s Daniel Goleman’s book Emotional Intelligence was so popular was because he championed the strengths of right-brained people. Right-brained people often struggle with feeling misunderstood and experience bouts of depression. 
   
- Love is the magician that pulls man out of his own hat. —BEN HECHT 
   
- Never desert your own line of talent. Be what nature intended you for, and you will succeed. —SYDNEY SMITH 
   
- • dislike intrusions and interruptions 
   
- The more I want to get something done, the less I call it work. -RICHARD BACH 
   
- Great ideas need landing gear as well as wings. —C. D. JACKSON 
   
- you develop a proper tempo for your life, you will be able to avoid stalls as well as a bushelful of depression and anxiety. It will be useful in all areas of your life. 
   
- give me the determination and tenacity of a weed. 
   
- “The tulip is an introvert among flowers.” Tulips are “naturalizers,” 
   
- Your sacred space is where you can find yourself again and again. —JOSEPH CAMPBELL 
   
- Most introverts need their own personal space because they tend to be territorial. They need an actual place to call their own. It gives them a sense of controlling their own energy. 
   
- Natural light is vital to all of us but especially to introverts, since they function on the less energized side of the nervous system. Natural light regulates levels of a hormonelike substance called melatonin, which has a powerful effect on mood, sleep, and the reproductive system. 
   
- Acetylcholine is an introvert’s main neurotransmitter. 
   
- best food sources for increasing acetylcholine are fish (salmon, herring, mackerel, sardines, and others), egg yolks (excellent source), wheat germ, liver, meat, milk, cheese, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and lecithin. 
   
- Happiness is not a station to arrive at, but a manner of traveling. -MARGARET LEE RUNBECK 
   
- Nice as it would be to stay within the confines of the familiar, it’s not always practical. 
   
- In addition, growth means feeling a little bit new to yourself. 
   
- being confident in yourself is a great place to start. 
   
- Introverts can also get caught up in the idea so pervasive in our culture that our personal value is based on what we do—not on who we are. 
   
- Confidence based solely on accomplishment limits your ability to expand and tackle new interests. 
   
- Confidence rests on an inner pledge. It’s an agreement you make with yourself to learn or do whatever you need to do in order to attain your goals. It’s the ability to be determined, curious, tolerant of mistakes, and kind to yourself as you learn new skills. No one can take your persistence or any of these qualities away from you. Introverts, especially, need to think about their internal abilities, since they may not have as many external accomplishments to lean on as extroverts do. Unlike Sean, they can’t even fool themselves that they feel confident. Here are some of the advantages they do have going for them: the ability to focus well for long periods of time, to be persistent, to take many factors into account, to master new information, to strive to do a good job, to contemplate, and to create in imaginative ways. These are just a few qualities on a pretty impressive list, I might add. Usually if I tell clients some of the qualities I see in them, they are surprised. “I never thought of those aspects of myself as valuable,” they often say. 
   
- When you discover you are riding a dead horse, the best strategy is to dismount. —DAKOTA SAYING 
   
- Try the following: 1. Pinpoint the pattern you want to change. 2. Do any part of it differently. 3. Try a solution you have used successfully in another situation. 4. Use paradox. Think of how you could make the problem worse. New solutions may occur. 5. Focus your attention on what you would like to have happen, not on what is happening. 6. Congratulate yourself for succeeding. There is something freeing about doing something out of your usual routine. 
   
- You must always do the thing you think you cannot do. —ELEANOR ROOSEVELT 
   
- Smiling lifts your innergy; it elevates your mood. Moving your facial muscles affects various neurotransmitters, directing where blood flows to the brain. 
   
- Research shows that people are perceived as smart if they speak quickly, in a loud voice, and they avoid slang words and phrases. 
   
- A laugh at your own expense costs you nothing. -MARY WALDRIP 
   
- By the time they are four years old, they giggle every four minutes. But by the time we reach adulthood, something sad happens. We laugh, on the average, only about fifteen times a day (even less for many adults). We lose an important part of our natural stress-relieving arsenal. 
   
- This above all: To thine own self be true ... -WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE 
   
- From your effort and courage to practice new techniques will come new friends, career options, romance, recognition from others, and—the most important of all—a solid sense of your own inner advantages and strengths. The world will benefit from your contributions. Leisure time at home will feel doubly refreshing because you won’t feel so isolated or guilty that you are avoiding life. A well-earned repose. 
   
- Be playful. Take breaks.   Appreciate your inside world. Be authentic. Enjoy curiosity. Stay in harmony. Revel in solitude. Be grateful. Be you. Remember, let your light shine.
