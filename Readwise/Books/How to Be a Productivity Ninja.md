- KNOWLEDGE WORK MEANS YOU’RE NOT JUST THE WORKER, BUT THE BOSS TOO 
   
- Knowledge work is about adding value or creating value out of information rather than performing a specific function. 
   
- In any knowledge work job, you’re really playing two different ‘roles’ at once: you’re simultaneously the ‘boss’ and the ‘worker’. 
   
- Yet, while you’re trying to crank through your to-do list, you’ll be making mental notes about all the new projects that need some precious thinking time. 
   
- STRESS IS REDUCED BY CLARITY CLARITY IS INCREASED BY ATTENTION 
   
- Your attention is a more limited resource than your time. 
   
- Attention is your currency. Time might be spent, but attention still needs to be paid. 
   
- Proactive attention: This is where you are fully focused, alert, in the zone and ready to make your most important decisions or tackle your most complex tasks.
