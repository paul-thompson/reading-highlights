- Kaizen means improvement. Moreover, it means continuing improvement 
   
- ‘Kai’ = change ‘Zen’ = better 
   
- The Kaizen is the concept of continual, small improvements – finding an area of your life that you want to improve, and then taking positive steps every day, even if it is only in a tiny way. 
   
- Remember, your Monkey only has two jobs – the main one is to keep you safe, but it is also there to stop you from making an arse of yourself 
   
- Always baby steps, onwards and upwards I’d go, 
   
- This is why applying the Kaizen to your relationship with food works. Don’t stop eating the things you like. Just eat less of them. 
   
- using the Kaizen approach: tiny steps, gradually, slowly, almost imperceptibly, but always moving forward.
