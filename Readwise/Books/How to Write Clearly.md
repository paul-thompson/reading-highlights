- William Strunk wrote The Elements of Style in 1918 and E.B. White (yes, that E.B. White) expanded and modernised it in 1959. A lot of its advice still applies – but a fair amount is dated. 
   
- how to turn that clear thinking into clear writing. Then how to make that writing better. 
   
- writing is a story with two sides. It’s a conversation, not a monologue. It involves both the writer and the reader. 
   
- it’s a process of communication, including both writing and reading, where two people are connected through language. 
   
- Clear writing depends on clear thinking. If your message isn’t clear to you, it won’t be clear to anyone else. 
   
- your writing won’t mean that much to them – if they read it at all. That’s why you have to consider the reader before you start to write. 
   
- If you want the reader to learn, you’ll need to explain the new ideas. If you want them to remember, you’ll have to make your message stick. And if you want them to do something new or different, you’ll have to make a convincing case. 
   
- The reader can only understand if you communicate, and you can only communicate if they understand. 
   
- The measure of clarity is the reader’s understanding. 
   
- Clarity is your responsibility, not your reader’s. You are talking, and they are listening. You’re the one who wants to get this message across, so you must put in the effort to make yourself clear. 
   
- With most non-fiction writing, the reader has something they need to do, or find out, and your writing will allow them to do it. 
   
- a big part of writing clearly is to start where the reader is now, and talk to them – not just at them. 
   
- The content of your writing is the words you put on the page. But just as important is the context in which those words are read – who the reader is, what they know, how they feel and what’s going on for them at the time they read your message. 
   
- Content is what you say, but context determines what the reader hears. 
   
- Clear writing is always useful in one-to-many forms of writing, like websites and articles. 
   
- the clearer your message is, the easier your life will be. 
   
- The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place. William H. Whyte 
   
- the same words can mean different things to different people at different times, or in different situations. 
   
- Since every writing project is different, there’s no magic formula for clear writing that will work in every situation. 
   
- You need to know who your reader is before you can write for them, because how they see your message will depend on where they’re looking from. 
   
- the clearer the picture you have of your readers, the clearer your writing will be. 
   
- you need to keep it in mind as you write, so you can stay focused on the things your reader is most interested in or concerned about. 
   
- Qualitative research (words) can include findings from customer surveys and client interviews, 
   
- Personas are helpful because they make your reader human, and that gives you a way to speak to them. 
   
- The problem with personas is that they reduce your whole readership to a single person. 
   
- For some projects, it might be more useful to think about what your reader wants or needs, as opposed to who they are. 
   
- you can write a user story. This is a brief sentence, written from the reader’s own perspective, that sums up what they want and need. 
   
- When [A], I need to [B] so I can [C]. 
   
- Where A is the reader’s situation, B is the task they need to do, and C is the goal they want to achieve. 
   
- user story cuts across the reader’s personal profile to focus on needs. 
   
- What does your reader know? 
   
- Ask yourself: What does my reader already know about my message? What do I want them to learn from my writing? How can I use what they already know to explain the things I want to say? 
   
- How does your reader feel? 
   
- your reader comes to your writing with their own emotions, and that will affect how they respond to what you write. 
   
- Researching your reader 
   
- The simplest approach is to talk to them. You could interview typical readers, carry out a survey or just chat to someone you know who is broadly similar to the reader. 
   
- Your interviewees are real, but they’re not necessarily representative. 
   
- In the digital realm, discussions on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn or Reddit could give you a window on the conversations people are having about your subject. 
   
- Positive reviews highlight preferences and desires; negative ones point to objections and pain points. 
   
- Here’s what to look for when researching your reader: 
   
- Words and phrases. What language do people use about your subject? 
   
- Knowledge and knowledge gaps. What do people know about your subject, and what do they need to find out? How can you bridge that gap? 
   
- Questions and answers. What questions do people ask about your subject? 
   
- Problems and unmet needs. What problems are people trying to solve? 
   
- Priorities and concerns. What are people most worried about? What’s their top priority? 
   
- Preconceptions. What are people already thinking when they come to your subject, and why? 
   
- Misconceptions. What mistaken ideas or false beliefs do people hold about your subject? 
   
- Emotions. What do people feel about your subject? What makes them excited or joyful? What makes them fearful or anxious? 
   
- Planning 
   
- Each time you sit down to write, you’ll have a reader you want to reach, a message you want to communicate and aims you want to achieve. 
   
- Your first job is to make sure the reader actually reads your words. 
   
- Next, you need to make sure the reader understands your message. 
   
- Not understanding is effectively the same as not reading: 
   
- you’ll want the reader to learn and remember your message once they’ve read it. 
   
- Beyond that, you may want to change what the reader thinks and feels 
   
- Finally, you might want to persuade the reader to act on your message, by making a strong case for why they should do something different. 
   
- Writing that changes your beliefs is rare, and writing that changes what you do is rarer still. 
   
- For example, if you just want the reader to download a free ebook, you’re only persuading them to click on a link. 
   
- If your mission statement is the destination, your plan is the route map. 
   
- Why bother to plan? 
   
- Unlike your mission statement, your plan isn’t set in stone. 
   
- editing is just as important as writing, and you can fine-tune the balance of your text at that stage.
