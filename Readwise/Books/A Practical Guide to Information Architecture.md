- And that’s what information architecture is all about: Organising content or objects Describing them clearly Providing ways for people to get to them.1 
   
- While most information architecture work these days is used for websites and intranets, you can find it wherever you need to organise things (information and/or objects) that other people need to use. 
   
- Figure 2 – 1. The basic parts of an IA project. Don’t worry if yours don’t look like this – every project is different 
   
- In an Agile team, this is turned on its head. Communication is conversation-centered – direct conversation is the primary means of communication, with documents playing a supporting role. 
   
- More rewarding Overall, a lean, iterative, and distributed approach to IA tends to make for a more rewarding practice 
   
- Usability specialists Usability specialists are often involved in the design of the IA as part of their project role. 
   
- IA often falls to the graphic designer on a project, as part of their role in designing navigation and page layouts. 
   
- Just like graphic designers, the job of designing the IA is often left to the front-end web developer. 
   
- Skills The skills that help most with IA work include: 
   
- The person creating the IA must genuinely care about understanding the people who will use the site, and be willing to represent their needs (and go in to bat for them when the pressure is on). 
   
- So much of this work involves grouping content into concepts and describing it, so great language skills are a must. 
   
- The person creating the IA is often one of a few people on a project who understands all the ins and outs (because they understand the strategy, people and content). 
   
- Communication skills are vital. 
   
- The IA: The overall structure of the site, groups, sub-groups and labels Navigation: Navigation bars, links and other ways of getting people to information (e.g. A-Z indexes, search) Documentation: Writing it all down (or communicating it in another way) so it can be built 
   
- Usability testing: Making sure the IA, navigation and other aspects of the project actually work for people 
   
- I saw this as an opportunity to take a more holistic view of a project, plugging the cracks, introducing those arcane arts ‘usability’ and ‘information architecture’. 
   
- realised that a large part of what IAs 
   
- Visual problem-solving: A lot of our work is ‘a puzzle’. We have to figure out how to make complex information and visuals as simple as possible, but no simpler than the target audience and creative brief require. 
   
- In my experience, people often know there’s something wrong – “Our website sucks”, “No-one can find anything on the intranet”, “We wrote the online help but everyone still phones the help desk”. 
   
- They are useful to help you: Set directions and priorities Make sure you are on track Assess requirements and requests: When someone asks for a new feature (like the organisation’s mission statement on the home page), you can find out whether it will contribute to the project goals. Make decisions: Will this new design feature support the goal? Is one approach better than another? 
   
- You’ll also be able to communicate and sell the draft IA more easily. When you can show how it will achieve the goals of the business, stakeholders will accept it more easily. 
   
- thing. Goals usually fall into three different types – making more money, reducing costs or helping people make better decisions. Example goals include: 
   
- Allow customers to find information about our services (which may lead to increased sales and reduced sales costs) 
   
- To measure change, you’ll need to know how you are doing at the beginning, and again at the end. Depending on your project, you may want to measure things like: 
   
- I’ve rarely created an IA before the technology was chosen. 
   
- One of the main things you’ll learn from user research is what information people need or are looking for. 
   
- Understanding people’s needs helps you: assess existing information to make sure it meets key needs identify information gaps make key information easy to find 
   
- prioritise content activities – release or rewrite the most important pages before the least important 
   
- it. People rarely want to just ‘find’ information – they usually want to do something with it as well. 
   
- Most likely you’ll find that some people know nothing about what you’re working on, while others will know a lot. 
   
- User research can help you find out a range of things – from learning broad patterns of behaviour to help you identify opportunities for new products, to getting a detailed understanding of how people do a particular activity. 
   
- When redesigning, one of the first steps on the content side of the project is to understand what you have already.
