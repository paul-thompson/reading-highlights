- Our brains are tired from staring into screens all day. Without the awareness of how to use our energy efficiently, we allow it to slip away. And this places a barrier on our ability to thrive and enjoy life. 
   
- This ability to master your energy is key to self-mastery – it’s a powerful force and the better you are at managing it, the greater the impact on the way you live and work. 
   
- Your focus must therefore shift from time management to energy management. 
   
- It’s an essential skill to master if you are serious about realizing your potential, because your best work can only flow from concentrating your attention on the things that matter to you.

- Investing in a healthier lifestyle is a wise strategy not just because it will contribute to a longer lifespan, but because it will also build your confidence, elevate your mood and unleash your creativity. 
   
- if you want to thrive and enjoy this rare gift of life, you must avoid focusing on only the grind and running yourself into the ground. 
   
- you plan on living a long life – one that is full of energy, excitement and adventure – this is where it begins. You must make your health a priority.

- ‘Most people equate losing sleep with having more time to enjoy the day or getting things done. Ironically, when they are sleep deprived, they enjoy the day less and are so unfocused that they are much slower in getting things done.’ 
   
- The reality is that our most productive days always begin with getting high-quality sleep, as it is this that sets the stage for better decisions, for waking up with greater energy and increased levels of emotional intelligence. 
   
- We are like a battery, and sleep is how we get to recharge that battery. 
   
- – bedtime procrastination if you will – starves you of the energy you need to be at your best come tomorrow morning. 
   
- how well you sleep is determined by what you do before going to bed. 
   
- The 3–2–1 rule 
   
- Three hours before bed, log off from all work-related activities and use this time to review your day and to plan the next day’s priorities. 
   
- Two hours before bed, say no to any more eating and use this time to wind down and get yourself in the right frame of mind for bed. 
   
- One hour before bed, escort any digital devices out of the bedroom and use this time for relaxing activities such as reading, journalling, taking a warm bath, visualization or meditation. 
   
- 2. Stop being a dayist 
   
- Going to sleep and waking up at the same time each day, even on weekends, will dramatically improve the quality of your sleep. 
   
- Given that we spend around a third of our lives sleeping, it makes sense to invest in a better sleep environment. 
   
- the shorter your sleep, the shorter your life. 
   
- ‘If there is an anti-ageing pill, I would call it exercise.’ 
   
- greater amounts of physical activity have been regularly associated with a lower risk of dying from cancer, and the more people move, the lower this risk. 
   
- Because the more you move, the more energetic you feel. 
   
- you just have a lot more energy when you’re fit. 
   
- Those who invest in a fitness tracker also find themselves moving on a more regular basis, and more inclined to take the stairs instead of the lift and to walk instead of drive. 
   
- Upgrade the quality of your fuel 
   
- in Japan and it was the best diet I ever had. Their diet is basically boiled vegetables, fish and rice. No fat, no sugar. You notice when you live there that there are no fat people. 
   
- the food you consume must be something that serves you. It should provide you with all the nutrients that your body requires to stay healthy. 
   
- Food is fuel, and the better the fuel, the better your body operates. 
   
- Unhealthy foods, it seems, can affect our mental health and kill our energy. 
   
- a few fundamental principles that have helped us to maintain a high level of energy: 
   
- Become a waterholic 
   
- With 60% of our bodies comprised of water, drinking enough of the stuff is essential to feeling energized and mentally sharp. 
   
- Think inside the bento box 
   
- used for centuries in Japan to control portion sizes and to carry delicious, nutritious food that is well balanced. 
   
- Go bananas 
   
- they deliver an immediate and substantial boost of energy, as well as containing nutrients that lift your mood. 
   
- the amount of energy we have determines what we do and the food we consume has a big role to play in this.’ 
   
- self-development begins with better self-awareness, and becoming a curious observer of your life is how you go from just existing to truly living with energy. 
   
- The less conscious we are, however, the more energy we leak 
   
- Few of us take regular time to pause and explore our thoughts without judgement. When you do, however, it will help you understand, interpret and respond to your emotions in a healthy way, as well as make sense of your life: 
   
- you can either have a cluttered mind or cluttered books. When you transfer the clutter from your mind, which can be psychologically draining on your energy, to paper, you will experience a feeling of lightness as those heavy thoughts no longer weigh you down. 
   
- He noted that when we express our gratitude to others, we strengthen our relationship with them. 
   
- Gratitude is one of the fastest ways towards feeling energized when we’re feeling low. It has the ability to transform a black and white day into one infused with colour. 
   
- By focusing on what it would feel like for important things or people to be taken away from us, we are reminded of just how fortunate we are and are energized to make full use of these blessings. 
   
- Until you are grateful for what you currently have, more will not make your life better because you will never be happy with whatever you get. 
   
- happiness is not found outside ourselves; it’s found from within and it begins with gratitude. 
   
- instead of looking for things to complain about, focus on the things you can be grateful for. 
   
- Death is not the greatest loss in life. The greatest loss is what dies inside us while we are still alive, and is why the graveyard is so often referred to as the richest place on earth, because it’s filled with dreams that were never realized and talents that the world never got to benefit from. 
   
- The Top Five Regrets of the Dying, Bronnie Ware – an Australian nurse 
   
- You were born with unique talents and gifts. And it’s the greatest adventure of life to discover what these are and how you can share these with the world. 
   
- What does success mean to you? What does fulfilment look like to you? What sort of impact do you want your life to have? What would you do if money were no object? 
   
- We must therefore make time to go inward to reflect on our own definitions and then have the courage to build our lives around those answers. 
   
- To live in this way – with purpose – is to unlock one of the greatest sources of energy that there is, 
   
- When you’re clear on what success means to you and you care about what you’re working towards, you will show up with vastly more energy in the form of creativity, focus and persistence. 
   
- The magnetic energy of a compelling vision 
   
- Author and educationalist Sir Ken Robinson pointed out that, ‘For most of us the problem isn’t that we aim too high and fail. It is just the opposite: we aim too low and succeed.’ 
   
- many will waste their time and energy tiptoeing through life feeling busy but going nowhere because they lack direction. 
   
- in the long run EQ does trump IQ. For without the ability to be a source of energy for others, very little can be accomplished.’ 
   
- ‘If your mental state isn’t good enough, you can’t bring yourself to bigger and better things.’ 
   
- While the practice of visualization in the world of sport is obvious and well-studied, it’s a powerful tool that we can also embrace in the achievement of our personal and career-related goals. This is an important step that you must practise daily if you want to move faster along the journey 
   
- Your ability to reflect, make plans and then actually follow through on them will become one of the greatest skills that you will come to master. 
   
- questionstorming. Unlike brainstorming, where the objective is to generate ideas and solutions, questionstorming is focused on generating a series of questions for us to act upon. 
   
- How you use your hours each day determines whether your vision will be realized or not. You need an energizing vision. But you must not get so distracted by it that you forget that the results you want are determined by how your energy is being spent today. 
   
- I understand just how dangerous being afflicted by comparisonitis can be. It’s the enemy of happiness, the thief of joy and an energy killer, whose sole purpose is to make you feel less satisfied with your own life. 
   
- To achieve more in life, therefore, you must learn how to master your energetic state, so that your mind is working for you and not against you. 
   
- Given that we have limited mental energy each day, we must also be mindful not to waste it on things that we have absolutely no control over. 
   
- I often tell clients that there are always two sells that occur – the second is selling yourself to others and the first is selling you to you. 
   
- You are both the sculpture and the sculptor 
   
- When you believe in yourself, in your capabilities, and that a better future is possible, however, you unlock the doors to an ocean of possibilities, unleash levels of energy you never knew existed and awaken the creative spirit that we are all born with. 
   
- Internal belief always precedes external achievement – it’s in this transference of energy that the physical equivalent of thought is generated and sculpted, the formless creating form.
