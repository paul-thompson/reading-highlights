- the people behind the British Broadcasting Company (BBC) website revealed that they define a modern browser as one that supports the following capabilities:
  1.document.querySelector() / document.querySelectorAll()

- References and Values 
  JavaScript variables hold data in one of two ways: by copies and references. Anything that is a primitive value is copied into a variable. Primitives are strings, numbers, Booleans, null, and undefined. The most important characteristic of primitives is that they are assigned, copied, and passed to and returned from functions by value.
  The rest of JavaScript relies on references. Any variable that does not hold one of the aforementioned primitive values holds a reference to an object. A reference is a pointer to the location in memory of an object (or array, or date, or what-have-you). The actual object (array, date, or whatever) is called the referent. This is an incredibly powerful feature, present in many languages. It allows for certain efficiencies:
  two (or more!) variables do not have their own copies of an object; they simply refer to the same object.
